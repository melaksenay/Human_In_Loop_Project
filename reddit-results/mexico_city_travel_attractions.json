It is a good compromise for us. \n\nIf you intend to spend some time in Mexico, I'd recommend applying for temporary residence if you meet their financial solvency requirements, otherwise, you would be limited to stays of up to 180 days as a tourist under the current entry scheme. For residence visas, you start at the consulate of Mexico nearest to your domicile to obtain a one-time visa to enter Mexico where you will complete the process to obtain your legal resident card. Once you have it, you can go in and out of Mexico for up to four years without worrying about your length of stay. At the end of four years, you can elect to convert to the permanent residence which is, as the name indicates, permanent and never needs to be renewed, and as a bonus, no financial solvency is required for that step. Easy process that opens a lot of doors for potential permanent relocation in the future. \n\nHere is the website of the consulate of Mexico in Calgary listing the requirements for temporary and permanent resident visas.\n\nhttps://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/calgary/index.php/consular-services/141-visas",

        "body": "Jealous! We actually went to Merida a few years ago too and loved it so much!\n\nHere’s my thoughts/the only useful things I can think to say haha…\n\n-If you don’t know any Spanish, try to learn some basics! It was really tricky for us not knowing much, particularly in Oaxaca and CDMX. Yucatan Peninsula felt easier.\n\n-Tulum felt very fake to me and nearly everyone seemed to be American, Canadian or European. It was beautiful and we loved the cenotes nearby but I wouldn’t rush back because it just felt inauthentic. The beach hotels are also extortionate. Maybe try Holbox? I’ve never been but apparently it’s amazing. I’m sure the same scenario with tourists but sometimes can’t be helped :)\n\n-The other place I wished we could have squeezed in rather than the extra days in Tulum was Bacalar, it looks amazing so maybe have a look at that too.\n\n-We got the ADO bus from CDMX - Oaxaca which I would recommend! The flights are cheap but you spend as much time getting to the airport, going through security etc as you would on the bus and the bus just felt way more convenient. We travelled overnight on the Platino and loved it, was honestly more comfortable than our sofa at home haha\n\n-If you want to go to the coast of Oaxaca, have a look at Aerotucán. It’s a mini plane which goes to Puerto Escondido and Huatulco from Oaxaca. The bus from there to the coast takes something like 10 hours through the mountains, flight is only 30 mins and it’s such a fun experience (the last photo is taken from the plane). More expensive obv but worth it. Book in advance as it sells out in peak season \n\n-We skipped Puerto Escondido as it was Easter and we heard it would be crazy. We went to Mazunte and a few beaches nearby, was lovely but much more wild and rugged than the Yucatan Peninsula. Some days we couldn’t swim at all because the waves were so rough! But that shouldn’t put you off because it’s still so beautiful, just in a different way, I was completely mesmerised by the waves! The language thing was less of an issue here as there are many tourists and expats on this stretch of coast.\n\n-We stayed in Condesa in CDMX and thought it was perfect, felt relatively safe, lots of good food nearby and nice hotels/airbnbs \n\n-In CDMX we found it chilly in the evening and morning but Oaxaca was mind meltingly hot so try to get a place with a pool for some respite from the heat!\n\n-Probably obvious but try to do any touristy attractions early. For example Hierve El Agua, we paid a taxi driver to drive us from Oaxaca at 7 but if I did it again I might say 6 would have been even better start time. \n\nMostly practical things but hopefully somewhat helpful!",

We then flew with Volaris from TIJ to BJX. No issued here. \n\n- Guanajuato is a beautiful city and very walkable. The celebrations were lively, beautiful and very moving, especially seeing people celebrate their loved ones in the cemetery. \n\n- The food was great, especially the street food. My favorite meal is a toss up between some Dorilocos I got from a street vendor and tacos from Tacos El Paisa. \n\nThe “Bad” (none of which was a super big deal)\n\n- Our hotel, Balcon del Cielo, was less than great. It’s at the top of the funicular and has great views and a skip the line, unlimited use funicular pass, which was nice. Howeve",

I’ve only had the misfortune of traveling with them 2 times (not really by choice) and both times the attention I received was pretty bad but not just that, the flight itself was soo bad; on one ocation we got into some pretty strong storm (not out the ordinary I guess but more than one person hit their head with the roof) and the pilot had the great idea of saying pretty much “thank god and volaris we lived” I mean I’m grateful to be alive but that sounds rather unprofessional in my opinion but that was okay; on the second ocation we actually almost FUCKING DIED because the guys forgot to ask permission to land!

I picked Guanajuato because I have family history there, have always been interested in visiting and I went with my brother, who has been before, so he took me to some cool places he found on previous trips\n\nAs far as the crowds, I wasn’t complaining about them, I definitely expected it to be crowded, with lots of people celebrating in the narrow streets.

When it was time to leave at check in I realized I only had my New York drivers license and not my green card with me. I pleaded to the check in lady and she said there was nothing she could do but she paused a little and went to speak with another one of her coworkers. From there it looks like her coworker gave her the idea to call some phone number that would allow them to verify my identify using only my NY drivers license. She had me text a picture of my ID to her and using her phone she sent that to whoever she was on the phone with. They verified my identify and confirmed I was a legally allowed to enter the US. But she did say once I arrive in the US and back in NY that they would fine me for not having my papers with me to fly. I thought it was strange but I said whatever it takes as long as I don’t miss my flight. Once my plane boarded though and I got back to NY when I went through customs and told them my situation they asked me to go with one of the U.S. customs and border protection security guys and they took me to a room with some sort of folder that had some paperwork of mine with my name on it. Once I got to the room they just asked me to sit tight and wait until my name was called. Eventually someone picked up my folder with my name on it and said you’re good and clear to go you can take the exit out. I didn’t speak to anyone or had anyone interrogate me. Using their system and whatever paperwork they had of mine they were able to see I was who I said I was and well apparently let me go. I left the room and was able to get my luggage and I didn’t hear or was told anything about a fine. So I was actually never fined. I assume maybe the flight attendant back in Mexico just wanted to make sure I was responsible about it next time. So you actually do have a chance of making your flight you just have to make sure it comes out of them to want to dial whatever number they dialed. If they don’t think of it kindly gesture them towards it and indirectly. Finally if you’re out of luck just give them my story and pass it off as it was your uncles story but do it as if you suddenly remembered it. Otherwise they might feel like you’re forcing them to do what they would topically do as a courtesy to you.",

Aside from Alexandria and the old Egyptian museum we saw pretty much everything there was to see. You could stretch a few extra nights to see the various light shows at the temples. I would have liked to spend an extra night in a Nubian village given the chance and spend an extra evening at a nice hotel in Aswan. \n\nWe booked a private tour and we were by ourselves with a guide + driver. I didn’t want to deal with a tour group and it was actually cheaper than the full guided group tours we saw online. We worked with an Egyptian company which was a bit of a gamble since they wanted to be paid in cash but it worked out well. It included food,  the cruise, all tickets to the temples, private guide and driver, airfare from Cairo to Aswan and drop off at our hotel at the Red Sea.They even had someone meet us at the gate in Cairo who got our visas and rushed us through immigration . We tipped about $35 a day to the guide and driver. Well worth the money \n\nAside from the traffic in Cairo we didn’t feel it was dangerous at all. Outside of Cairo there were a lot of places that you were isolated from everything with no cell signal so I would have been a bit worried if we broke down. \n\nThere were police checkpoints set up and heavy security (guards with assault weapons and bomb sniffing dogs) at all the sites. Felt as safe as anywhere else and the police are pretty much defaulting ‘to keep the tourists safe’ mode. If they see you are being harassed they’ll intervene and tell the person to knock it off. \nThe Cairo airport police actually waived us through most of the security checks to get into the airport. The only crime we saw was a young kid steal something from a shopkeeper in the bazaar which actually turned into something like a scene from a film with the kid falling down as he looked behind him and the shopkeeper screaming and waiving his fist",

We spent more than a week, also probably because we have all the time in the world and are slow traveling. However, we can easily go back for more time in Oaxaca. We learnt how to make mole, did a bunch of mole tasting, we went to alebrijes workshop, went to hierve el agua, mitla, and so much more. If you are also up for traveling you can get to the coast and enjoy the beach and surfing if the season is right. honestly, folks that are saying Oaxaca is not the best I would challenge that, coming from being a traveler who drove all around the country for 8 months exploring, talking, and immersing myself with tons of locals :) Oaxaca is NOT overrated and if you ever get a chance please be there for day of the dead.

It's not far from Cancun and easy to reach by a taxi and ferry from Cancun. There are some nice hostels on the island and it's a nice laid-back place (although during the day it gets a lot of partiers from Cancun). \n\nOaxaca is a much nicer town and you should be fine staying in hostels there. Just be careful drinking and coming home late at night (as you should be in any unfamiliar place). \n\nI live in Merida which is a very safe city (the safest in MX) and it is reachable by bus from Cancun (4 - 5 hours by bus). There are beaches near Merida (about 30 minutes away) but it's not a beach town. If you want a safe beach town I'd hop over to Isla Mujeres. \n\nI'd avoid Playa del Carmen (if you were considering it), as I have not heard great things about safety there lately.

Each custom map can be saved elsewhere as a kml or gpx file. \n\nEdit: for clarification.",

Did you show a printed copy of your SAE submission? That would’ve been the first red flag if you hadn’t completed that.\n\nThe second is an unknown length of stay. If you cannot prove you’re leaving within 180 days, then you may be denied entry. One way to prove intent to leave is an onward ticket out of the country. But if you have a concrete plan just no set date yet. Yours wasn’t a concrete plan. A concrete plan would’ve been “stay in Mexico City for the rest of this month, then go to X city for Y days, and we will then be booking a flight to (countries) that we haven’t decided exactly which yet (explain why you don’t have a concrete plan yet).\n\nYes, officers may use having no “exit travel” booked as a reason to deny entry - it’s all about you proving to the officer at border control that you will, 100%, without a doubt, comply with the terms of your visa (even if you’re admitted without needing a visa, that’s effectively a visa restriction list).\n\nYou are correct that “meeting boyfriend” is a red flag. However you should never lie if they ask as that has worse consequences. This is because people who are meeting loved ones and have no onward ticket booked frequently overstay. Now, if it were a businessman saying “yeah it’s because I have a conference planned and I don’t know if I’m going to have meetings the day after yet so my company hasn’t booked it yet”, then that may be different.\n\nAny time you enter a country, you must provide proof you are not going to be financially insolvent (need welfare or become homeless/etc) during your entire time in the country. You generally can’t rely on the money someone not traveling with you has supposedly promised to use to pay for your basic necessities like food, etc. Yes, providing a bank statement along with proof that bank card will work in Mexico would likely have satisfied this.\n\nYour “story” sounds a lot like just trying to blame others/shift the focus here. I highly doubt that you aren’t exaggerating some of these details quite a bit. But even if it was like you say, you attempted to enter a country and were denied entry as you did not comply with entry requirements. This is entirely your fault. Long wait times for secondary screening can be expected during busy travel times. And your flight back to Europe would’ve had to be booked by the airline who originally flew you into Mexico - so the next flight likely was the next day.\n\nNone of this is a “concentration camp”. You were being deported for not meeting entry requirements. At that point, yes, you basically are a criminal for attempting to enter without valid documentation. They aren’t going to spend money on making it a spa day for criminals waiting for flights out of the country. Bottom line is this is your fault and your hyperbole and exaggerated “stories” don’t do anything but make it look like you’re trying to blame everyone else for you screwing up.",

(i.e. EU citizens or US citizens usually have a much easier time travelling than people from the Middle East or Eastern Europe, not fair but fact) And not everyone seems to catch up on that.\n\nMost countries are pretty clear in their immigration and tourism sites as to what is needed if one travels outside an organized group in terms of documents and proof that they are not planning to immigrate illegally. (I am a bit baffled that you would not be aware that many people try to immigrate to the US though Mexico frequently... I mean, that whole Trump building a wall, was not just a fun entertainment stunt of a deranged madman) \n\nAnyways, it was a bit naive to not bring any documents of your travel plans, not have a return ticket or sufficient funds etc. And not having any plans as to which country to go to next? It is like you are waving red flags left and right, even before mentioning a boyfriend. It is like you are saying \"I am coming into your country, did not bother looking up any regulations or requirements and might just disappear into middle/south America while I am at it\" (sorry for being harsh, I know you are already aware that the whole thing could have been planned better and I feel really sorry that your boyfriend was equally no help in you planning your time together properly)\n\nAs for the other travelers you encountered. Bringing pregnant people, old people or young children/toddlers/babies is actually a scheme that a lot of illegal immigrants bank upon. It makes them blend better. And there are organizations who come to help elderly or families much faster than to solo people, when they try to enter a country illegally. Having a child born in a certain country also opens a legal loophole, as most countries give that child citizenship and as their carer the mother might be given rights to stay because of it. \n\nI am not saying the people you encountered were all illegal immigrants. But they all share with you that they probably raised a lot of red flags, possibly unintentional, and that is sadly the consequence. Border police see A LOT of that. Every day. \n\nI think it is almost inevitable that they will not care much for the 5647th time they hear a variation of the same story. I agree that the way people are treated when in detention could probably be improved in a lot of places. Officers could get at least some training as to how to behave in such situations and regulations of what to provide to people during detention are long overdue. Even if they are suspected criminals.",

        "body": "I remember your pre-trip post vaguely.  I could sense the concerns you had and knew you'd completely forget about them once you arrived.  Sounds like you had a blast! \n\nI'll be one of the dissidents here and caution against places like Merida, Oaxaca, and especially San Miguel de Allende.  I get the sense that you don't want to be surrounded by other foreigners (like us when we visit these days).  These are all prime American/Canadian-friendly destinations, which is fine except you seem to want to connect more locally.  You will probably encounter the same gravitation towards North Americans and Europeans there -- especially San Miguel de Allende.  You'll be amazed how many old white people you run into there... more than back home even maybe ha.\n\nI second Guadalajara.  For Mexico's second largest city, it doesn't quite have the same cosmopolitan nature that CDMX has.  It definitely feels more \"Mexican\" if that makes sense.  There are some pretty good day trips to be had from there too - Tequila (touristy but a lot of Mexicans visit there too); Guachimontones; hiking; and Lake Chapala (if you find yourself craving more old white people lol).  \n\nFor beach towns, consider the Pacific as unfortunately almost all Yucatan destinations are overrun with foreigners (even Isla Holbox).  Puerto Escondido was definitely a great recommendation above.  We like Puerto Vallarta too, but lately it has had way too many foreigners, some with their entitled/reckless Covid/general North American ways which is unfortunate for a city that depends so heavily on tourism.  The Oaxaca coast is still a little too \"rough\" for many of them (some of whom only want to go to all-inclusives so they don't have to step foot in \"real Mexico\"...).   Also consider Zipolite and Puerto Angel in coastal Oaxaca.\n\nHonestly, you should do yourself a favor and definitely return to CDMX but choose to visit places that aren't tourist magnets.  I will say our experience is that chilangos (the people from CDMX) are the most open and English-friendly of Mexico.  We discovered more of it as we went deeper.  Five visits in, we're uncovering more local experiences and will be living there next year for a bit.  Upping your Spanish-speaking game should help you get the more local feel you seek.\n\nAnd, yes, for a city of 20 million they are definitely way up there on the friendly scale.",

Según él, lo demás de mis impuestos puedo y debo seguir pagando a los estados unidos. No hay sistema obligatorio para que los extranjeros paguen impuestos en ganancias extranjeras. Es una falla sistémica y la única solución está en las manos del estado.\n\nIgual de las rentas astronómicas, y el desalojamiento. No podemos decir que no hay ninguna culpa con las personas que pagarían lo que cobren, llevar sus presupuestos extranjeros de vivienda a otro contexto, pero es el papel del gobierno poner restricciones en la subida de renta, proteger a inquilinos de largo plazo en cualquier zona, restringir la densidad etc de los Airbnbs, etc. Las personas individuales no tienen control de los sistemas que permiten esos abusos, y dejar que las personas que realmente tengan la culpa siga haciendo lo mismo mientras griten que se vayan los gringos significa que nada va a cambiar.

Flying out of SoCal.\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\nI'm a low key traveler, I am into seeing how the local live, I'm not into alcohol or party, I like nature and some cultures, interaction with local is warmly welcome. I'm also very interested but kinda scared lol to visit places like Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Chile, Cambodia, Venezuela, and the like.\nTime:1-2 weeks.\n\nMy budget is a step above backpacking. I'm willing to stay in hostel, but not willing to eat cup noodles.  Thank you for your help!",

I was miserable. Then I got out the app that shows where the blossoms were at their peak and jumped on a train for Hirosaki and then Hakodate. What a difference! Calm and tranquil, virtually no tourists, and indescribably beautiful.\n\nOne of the great things about Japan is that it's safe no matter where you go. There are many business hotels which have small rooms, but with private bathrooms and public sento and laundry machines, that can be had for under $100US per night.\n\nWith the yen so weak against the dollar right now, it's a great time to visit Japan.",

Just because 1 level alone won't solve the problem, doesn't mean it isn't a necessary first step.\n\n40% of the water is lost en route.  That's insane. (10% is considered a general acceptable upper limit in large systems)  Imagine 2,000,000 more people arriving in the city and outcry that would cause about water.... the status quo is worse.\n\nIncentive structures can certainly be introduced into public systems even if it is the exception.  Public/private partnerships where you can bring in state of the art German engineering if we can overcome our pride. But even if the infrastructure wasn't fixed, higher prices do have a direct line to less usage.  Less usage also means less pressure on infrastructure.\n\nAnd all of this can be done while still subsidizing the poor (or everyone, as it currently is) for \"basic\" levels of water usage.  There is no reason we need to be subsidizing people in Polanco so they tap 30m3 per month at 300 pesos.

(Which was 11-4 years ago, so not that much should have changed) \n\n\nBeach, relaxation, chill, snorkeling: \n- Greece - Santorini, stay on Kamari beach not on the cliff side. \n- Vanuatu - Port Villa, stay at the Warick, Le Lagon or iririki. It’s what you wish Fiji was, it’s the same glitz in the resorts, but actual culture is unavoidable and beautiful. Ask the locals which turtle sanctuaries, waterfalls etc to go to, many have been bought out by foreign investors and its always a much more beautiful experience going to the places owned and operated by the Vanuatu people who truly care for their land. \n- Philippines - Boracay. Can’t go wrong. \n- Thailand - Phuket. I wouldn’t stay on patong beach with 16 year olds… or at all. It’s fun for the day but stay somewhere a $10 grab away from the mayhem on a nice tranquil beach. \n\n\nCity, shopping, buzz, arts, everything at your fingertips: \n- Singapore - it’s often overlooked as a destination, but stay anywhere on sentosa!! It’s super safe, there’s a universal studios and it was honestly heaven at 15. Great shopping and food too! \n- Vietnam - Hoi An. Stay on the beach, I recommend the Citadines. Fun, culture, there’s a theme park with the worlds longest ski lift pagola thing? Great food and they have tailors to get custom clothes and shoes made, very cool for both boys and girls. \n- Athens - there’s truly so much to do and so many islands and towns you can explore on a day trip. So much history in the midst of (teen friendly) beach clubs and restaurants where you can smash plates and dance! \n- France - I hate Paris, stay for a night or 2 and go to Paris Disney, then go to literally anywhere else. Paris is very alluring if you’ve never been, but unless they’re super into arts and learning French, just go to Disney then head south. I was 16 at boarding school in the south, and I remember it being the absolute best place on earth, but that could have been the fact you could buy alcohol at the self check out XD\n\nAdventure, history, thrill, active\n- Cambodia: do a few days on a beach, could be cool to do a tour. 16 year old history buffs will go insane at the museums and temples. There’s also enough of the fun touristy stuff to go around. \n- Australia: Sydney + jambaroo/don’t just do Sydney.  Australia has so many iconic things that are just so out of the way it’s not super popular to holiday here. There’s everything from theme parks, amazing beaches, shopping, art and history. Take a 2 night trip to somewhere like jambaroo, which has a huge water park (stay at Ben rickets for a real Aussie experience) or if you’re up for a drive, do some cabining in north durris and you will see 10x more kangaroos than people, surf, and explore a bit of the untouched Australia left. \n- New zeland - hop around. Start in Auckland, go to hobbiton, dickeys flat is my fav, there’s honestly no wrong place to go. \n\n\nMy top pick for any 16 year old:\nSingapore. Sentosa. There’s really something for everyone. \n…you can also always stop over in Singapore and get out for a few nights, but I truly had the most pg fun at 16 in Singapore. \n\nAnywhere you take them, they’ll love!!

We left the resort for a few meals and one or two experiences but it’s Mexico-you won’t break the bank. \n\nCongrats and best of luck! \n\nPS-if you do go to Cabo, don’t let anyone in the airport talk you into doing anything. Just walk completely outside of the airport to your shuttle and don’t talk to anyone. People claim to work for your hotel or the airport and try to sell you on see through bottom boat tours and dinner cruises inside the airport, etc. It’s stupid annoying. Don’t fall for it.",

The city is also known for its unique architecture, including the famous works of Antoni Gaudi, such as the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, and Casa Batllo. You can also explore the Gothic Quarter, a charming area with narrow streets, historic buildings, and cafes. In the evenings, there are plenty of bars and clubs to choose from, including the famous Opium nightclub.\n\nValencia, on the other hand, has a more relaxed atmosphere and a beautiful beach as well. The city is known for its futuristic architecture and cultural landmarks, such as the City of Arts and Sciences, which is a complex of museums, galleries, and performance venues. The Old Town of Valencia also offers a glimpse into the city's rich history, with its beautiful squares, churches, and markets. In the evenings, there are plenty of bars and clubs to choose from, including the famous Marina Beach Club.\n\nBoth cities are easily accessible by train, with a journey time of around 3 hours. As for hostels, there are plenty of options to choose from in both cities, depending on your budget and preferences. Some recommended hostels in Barcelona include Sant Jordi Hostels, Generator Hostel Barcelona, and Kabul Party Hostel. In Valencia, some recommended hostels include Home Youth Hostel, Red Nest Hostel, and Center Valencia Youth Hostel.\n\nI hope you have a great trip!",

We stayed in Puebla street. For food there's a small franchise restaurant that I recommend to you and your family. It's called La Parroquia, it has a good time schedule, it's located on Cozumel street near Chapultepec avenue... traditional Mexican food and not spicy. But you need to ask about it wherever you go. Little spicy for us mexicans can be too much for foreigners... Uber it's OK, check prices before you need a trip.\n\nPalacio de Bellas Artes it's a great place to visit too...\n\nIf your kids liked Coco, in one side of Palacio de Bellas Artes it's located the Palacio Postal (old postal office) in the movie when Miguel arrives to the dead world, the office model was taken from the Palacio Postal, it's a beautiful building and your kids will find familiar that place... Around the corner from the Palacio Postal it's the Palacio de Minería on Tacuba street (old mining school), inside this building there's a small collection of meteorites... you need to check if in those days there is a Book fair in that place, which means plenty of people...\n\nAn old reference name forma México city was the City of palaces...\n\nEnjoy your trip and visit. If you need advice or look for especific directions, you can DM.",

So, I decided to wander around and find something else. \n\n\nWithin a couple of minutes I found this tiny restaurant, with seating for maybe 10 (this included a couple of small tables on the alley outside). There was a small glass meat display case (all unlabeled, if memory serves), and a propane burning cooktop with not much else aside from a drink cooler. \n\n\nA couple of locals were seated outside, so I decided to give it a shot. I walked up and ordered by pointing to the meats I wanted to try, and agreeing that I wanted cilantro and onions.\n\n\nI ordered 4 tacos, and then I ordered 4 more after scarfing those down in like 3 minutes. Still not really sure what meats I ordered, and I'm sure part of it was that I was starving, but that was my favorite meal in CDMX.\n\n\nI've been to a few of the famous spots that you've seen on YouTube, Google and Netflix, and they are all worth a shot and definitely delicious. But I think the point of my rambling (if you're still here, thanks lol) is that my favorite meal there was a place I'll probably never find again, that I discovered just by walking around. Mexico City is the perfect place to do that, and to me the whole ordeal was an integral part of the experience of that wonderful, chaotic city.",

Would he had use Uber instead? Is that something he would have done? if so, see if you can reach out to uber and find out if there is anyway to get travel confirmation from him. And to be even more pointed, can you guess his login and try to log in to his uber account and see what you can find? \n\nLets say he doesnt do uber, if he took a taxi, any taxi at the airport would be legit. Hardly a point of concern to be frank with you. Could some Bullshit happen to a taxi on the way to the hotel? yes but it would be on the news by now. that would be very big if it happened. So I am going to assume thats not the case. It doesnt mean its not the case, just not likely in the list of possibilities. \n\nSo that brings us to immigration. If he was detained by now he would have had access to his phone, Its not like they put them into cages without access to a phone. So I am also not super sure about this. But here is where the situation turns into a big enigma to be honest. Its odd that he hasnt reached out yet. This could be due to a number of reasons. No battery, Lost phone or stolen phone. Someone would have offered him a phone call by now. \n\nI suspect 7/10 that he is unable to reach yall due to not having his phone which meant he lost access to his boarding pass, hotel info and a way to reach out.

We were quietly looking at the tombstone checking the names and ages of the young men who perished in WW2.  While there, we noticed a young family, mom, dad and 2 small children.  The father approached us asked if we were Canadian, we told him yes, we were from Toronto.  He then proceeded to ask us to come to their house for dinner that evening.  We were both a little surprised, but we accepted.  That evening we arrived, there were 2 other couples and their children there as well.   They told us that they were honoured to have us in their home and proceeded to tell us that Canadian soldiers had liberated their village during WW2 and as a sign of respect, each family had adopted a tombstone in the cemetery, it was there responsibility to maintain the Canadian soldier’s grave.  The children would then study the soldiers background and learn about their lives prior to going to Europe to fight.  These kids knew everything about Canada, it was amazing!  They said whenever they met a Canadian they would welcome them into their homes.  The respect they had for our contribution to WW2 was awe inspiring.  We exchanged addresses, when we got home my girlfriend sent all of the children Blue Jays ball caps and tshirts (they had just won their 1st World Series). She has kept contact with the wives over the years, she gets Christmas cards every year.  2 of the children visited Canada when they finished their schooling, 18 year old boys, they stayed with my ex and her now husband, I visited them too.  They remembered us like we were family.  I look back at that chance meeting in a cemetery with warmth in my heart.  There’s a country who actually appreciates us.",

It just didn't feel comfortable having to always travel from one gated complex to another and feel at constant risk of dealing with robbery, violent crime, corrupt police, etc.  Those problems still exist in Mexico but if you can handle South Africa, Mexico will be easy for you.\n\nI've lived in Mexico City for several months, and it is much safer than South Africa.  I recommend living around Condesa or Roma.  Those neighborhoods are near Parque Mexico and Parque Espana, which have big areas for children to play, and on the weekends you can go to Chapultapec Park which is bigger than Central Park in NYC.   \n\nThe rents are more expensive in those places, especially short-term, but you should be able to find a decent apartment near there long-term for less than $1500 USD per month.  In other parts of the city you can find cheaper rents.  Check [hoodmaps.com](https://hoodmaps.com) for an idea of which neighborhoods to avoid for safety reasons.\n\nI've been all over the world, and CDMX is one of the best cities in the world in terms of all-around quality of life.  It has a decent climate, great food, it's affordable, very walkable and with uber so cheap that going car free is entirely reasonable.  And for weekend trips, transportation to nearby cities by bus is comfortable and cheap.  The buses are like coaches with TVs in each seat, not like a crowded African matatu.   And you can fly to a beach city like Puerto Vallarta, Puerto Escondido or Cancun for $50 to $100, except for during Christmas and Easter when demand is high.\n\nAnd Mexicans are some of the most friendly, fun-loving people I've ever met.

(Incidentally I don’t live in those areas and chose a relatively poor area because I didn’t want to be around so many foreigners). I feel safer in those areas than most US cities and my hometown, London. Just be vigilant - no expensive Jewellery, Watches, Cameras etc. But that’s true anywhere. I’ve never had issues with police here in the city (actually I’ve found them to be very helpful), but I have had issues with police in other places in Mexico wanting bribes for driving offences (Acapulco, playa Del Carmen etc). The city has heaps of great parks, incredible food and lots of things to keep your kids occupied. You do read a lot of negative things about security here, but my own experience is that it isn’t as threatening as you read so long as you don’t wander into areas in the city where you shouldn’t (and you will get to know those pretty quickly but would have no reason to go there anyway). In CDMX a lot of the crime that involves foreigners is petty theft, not the serious stuff (that’s not true in other parts of Mexico especially in the north where kidnappings etc happen).\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to paint a rosy picture.

All of the drug cartel related crimes you see on the news don’t happen here that often and only in specific neighborhoods. The police is helpful in general, there’s a lot of corruption and some will ask for bribes because people don’t follow the traffic regulations for example, but if you are in need, they will help you out. It is very kid friendly, there are a lot of parks, activities and other things to do and places to visit, it is a huge huge city, they won’t get bored. There are also a lot of magic towns (Pueblos Mágicos) near the city if you want to spend a weekend over there. I personally don’t like Acapulco but it is nice and it is the closest beach to the city, but you can drive to other places not that far away. Your kids are at a great age as well to learn Spanish and start school here, it won’t be that hard for them because they’re still very young and will learn quickly how to communicate.

I would recommend just learning basics like how to ask for things and properly addressing people (good morning, thank you, please,etc). Most people accommodated me really well because I was polite when I spoke. Google translate can be really helpful if you have a complicated question. I would make sure you have Mexican currency on hand for Ubers as they charged me in cash and not card. I stuck to the touristy areas mentioned above. Found nice places to eat on the fly. Dont be afraid to walk around, but know your surroundings. Keep a downloaded map on your phone so you can easily get around. My favorite neighborhood was El Coyocan because I went there to see Frida Kahlo's house and just fell in love with everything. Close second favorite was my visit to Chapultepec (nice park and castle), and shortly after, I went to a museum of natural history, which was mind-blowing. Each neighborhood has something unique to see. Like Condessa and Roma felt like hipster spots. Polanco was bougie. It's not my vibe, but I loved a museum of art there. The neighborhood around Zocolo was super cool as well. However, it got shady in certain parts past the main area. All in all, I walked a lot and often at night. No one bothered me. But I was sure to stay in areas where I wouldn't have issues. Don't wander around without knowing where you're at. The city is huge. Have a great trip!",

Right now Austria and Germany place countries into one of three groups:\n\n1. Low risk. Everybody can enter with a negative test or vaccine.\n2. High risk. If you aren't vaccinated, you can enter with proof of negative test and a quarantine. A test a few days after arrival can end the quarantine. Vaccinated travelers are exempt from quarantine. And you have to fill out a form before arrival.\n3. Virus variant areas - this is a tiny list of countries where there may be new variants that haven't yet taken hold in the EU. Mandatory quarantine, no exceptions for vaccinated travelers.\n\nAustria has the US in group 1, Germany moved the US to group 2 a few weeks ago. Banning vaccinated American travelers would require them to move us to group 3 (which is unlikely because delta's not a new variant of concern and has already spread in the EU) or create an entirely new set of restrictions and rules just for the US.\n\nI would assume Austria will move the US to group 2, and other countries will follow suit with similar requirements. If you're vaccinated, nothing changes, other than possibly filling out a form before you arrive and maybe a pre-departure test. I already booked mine at CVS just in case.\n\nI hate the uncertainty, and it's possible we could be banned completely, but I don't think that's likely.\n\ntl;dr - get the fucking vaccine.",

Some notes on my experience...\n\nMy trip went as well as it could under the circumstances- I was visiting an Italian friend and we did a mix of sightseeing and just hanging out. Per him the crowds are much less than normal but I still felt very crowded at some sites, but maybe that was just after 18 months of not being in crowds. The Vatican museum was the most packed but per my friend that was nothing, so it’s a good time to go from that perspective. I brought a supply of N95s and wore those everywhere including in the weeks before the trip. No fun in 90+ degree heat in Rome or 8 hours on a plane but worth it for that sweet sweet negative antigen test. \n\nThe green pass system seems very well integrated already and I had no issues with my CDC card being accepted along with my passport as a photo ID. I brought a couple of the BinaxNow tests but just used them to self test to calm my nerves and got a test at a pharmacy to fly back - this was very straightforward. \n\nFlying out of Rome was more streamlined than leaving the US but I would allow a lot of time on both ends as there are lots of document checks that can slow things down. Most of the kinks seem to have been worked out, though. \n\nOverall I had a really great time and loved Rome. I’m glad I went because I missed my friend, but I’ve been so stressed out about this trip and am so relieved to be back. It definitely took a lot of the fun out of things, but probably a less anxious person would have fared better. I’m not going to be planning another international trip until things improve because I am too risk averse, lol. \n\nGood luck to everyone traveling soon!",

So far, only French nationals with foreign vaccinations could benefit from the Converter.\n\n\\- **How the** ***Converter of certificates*** **can be accessed for foreign vaccinations is not defined yet** in the decrees published today. The government reportedly has a draft version of a decree about that, so it may be published anytime now (maybe in time for tomorrow?).  \nBut the [authority in charge of privacy](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000043915894) suggested to the French ministry of Foreign Affairs that **foreign vaccination proof owners upload on an online portal** the scans of: the vaccination proof, an ID document, a proof of residence abroad and the dates of travel.  \nThe French ministry of Foreign Affairs also offered to **create desks with tourism office agents who will do the conversions in Paris airports (CDG and ORY)**, the privacy authority did not oppose the idea.\n\n\\- **self-tests (auto-tests) performed under supervision of a healthcare worker will work for the French** ***Health Pass*** and will be offered in pharmacies.   \nI see here a big problem: people who ask for a test without specifying that they travel internationally may unknowingly get a self-test and be stuck at the border. Self-tests are not sensitive enough based on international travel standards, travellers need a PCR test or an antigen test to cross a border.   \n**Always state if you need the test results to travel internationally when in France!**\n\n\\- **PCR, Antigen, self-test negative results with a valid QR code will be valid 72 hours for the Health Pass** from the time they were performed.  \nIf you use them to travel internationally, the validity will not be the same: not valid for self-tests, 72-24 hours for PCR and antigen depending on the destination.  \nNote: negative test results perfomed in EU/EEA with an EU DCC QR-code should be accepted under the same validity conditions in France.

Fast food is the street taco, quesadilla, gorditas, etc.\n\nAlthough McDonald's is not too bad, but the rest are \"transferred\" with prices in dollars, which yeah makes it expensive for pesos, that's the whole reason. But then is marketed to a different segment of the population, is clean, nice and better quality like IHOP, Carl's Jr, Burger King, Chilli's, Applebee's, or even freaking Olive Garden.

Based on what I was reading online I expected a gentrified tourist hotspot filled with gringos but that’s definitely not the experience we had. As the only Spanish speaker in a group of 6 i found that verrry few people knew English and the vast majority of the city is filled with locals and we didn’t see that many tourists especially compared with major cities in Europe.  The city is massive and there’s so many neighborhoods which all feel different from each other. So many sights to see and the food is excellent. Frankly I preferred the tacos over the pricier fancier spots but you have plenty of choices. Additionally, this may be the greenest big city I’ve ever seen. So much of the city is covered in trees and it’s quite walkable as a whole. On",

I would spend at least three days in the Black hills: one day in Wall/Badlands, one day in Mount Rushmore/Crazy Horse, and one day in Deadwood. When you visit Deadwood, spend the night there. That's minimum. \n\nWe don't have public transportation that tours the Hills or goes from town to town, so you will need to drive. If you don't have your own car, it is well worth it to rent one. Towns are generally 35 miles or so apart, as this was the furthest a covered wagon could travel in a day. \n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you (or anyone else) have about the Black Hills or the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.

I took a punting tour, had the famed Fitzbillies Chelsea Buns, and saw the famed Watson and Crick pub, named the Eagle. \n\nThe weather was mild despite it being mid December. \n\nI took a walking tour, I was literally the only person on it, and took lovely photos at the golden hour. \n\nI had nice lunches and dinners that I recall as being quite affordable. I went to a seasonal pantomime, Dick Whittington and his Cat, which was the absolute oddest travel experience of my life. Everyone was eating ice cream indoors, though it was the dead of winter, and the entire plot was a running gag about a Dick and his pussy, despite the show being designed for families. They even had the most ribald character bring kids on stage, ask them what they wanted Father Christmas to give them and say their favorite part of the show. I loved it. \n\nThe city has a wonderful market, tons of book stores and cute boutiques.",

Easy tourist mark.  It's also paying attention to your surroundings, so not on your phone while you are walking.  \n\nRecognize the signs that this is not an area you should be.  It could be that suddenly there are no more pedestrians around (did you accidentally take a wrong turn and there's a reason no one is around?).  It could be that there are a lot of broken windows, graffiti, or other signs that this doesn't cater to tourists.  Who to ask for assistance (not the two guys standing on the street corner in super oversized coats when it's hot outside).\n\nThe reason why it's \"street smarts\" instead of \"book smarts \" is it can be difficult to learn them without experience.  But awareness can take you a long ways, and know that you will make mistakes and hopefully they won't be bad and you can learn from them.  For example, I have been \"swindled\" by street scams a few times.  Super classic scams, but I fell for them the first time I saw it, and it only cost me ten dollars.

Rome is a big capital city with a LOT going on. It has dozens more galleries and museums than you saw. It has hundreds more archaeological sites than you saw. It has far more culture than you saw. It has vast beautiful parks with Roman acqueducts running through them; it has an original Roman road running for miles into the countryside; it has genteel parks full of Victorian follies; it has modern architecture and an entire suburb built in futurist style.\n\nI agree it's chaotic - it drives me crazy too - but you saw a tiny dot and drew incorrect conclusions about the whole.\n\nNaples is a trip. I personally love it but I get how it could be intimidating. Try the underground experience and get out to the seafront castle.\n\nRe. food, in the US there's a lot of reliance on sugars, glutamates, and acids to boost flavor. Real Italian food is all about simplicity and the ability of the ingredients to speak. If you give it time you will attune to what's going on. But also if you've confined yourself only to tourism centers then you're likely being [ripped off](https://romevacationtips.com/how-to-avoid-tourist-trap-restaurants-in-rome/).\n\nMy strong suggestion is to get into the suburbs of whatever city youu're in. Or a train to a small town, maybe in Tuscany, hang out in the central piazza, drink a couple of glasses of house wine, eat in a little trattoria with no English menu.",

Public transportation is not great for a city that is very big.\n I think you should go to less touristic places in Rome like Ostiense, EUR (those are neighborhoods), Pigneto: they are not as touristic as the Coliseum and other typical stuff but they are amazing (for examples, look for piramide cestia and squared coliseum). \n\n\nI would not worry about Florence because it's smaller than Rome, but if you have the same problem I would suggest going to cities in Tuscany that are as beautiful as Florence but smaller. Try looking into Lucca and Pisa, they are quite close to Florence if I recall correctely. \n\n\nSorry for the Wall of text and I Hope you enjoy the other parts of your trip!",

I think Lagunilla is a must-see and if you're smart (don't flash your expensive phone or money, don't buy weed or other drugs as a tourist, watch your pockets, etc.) you'll be fine.  Lagunilla and Tepito both are just outdoor street markets (Tianguis) on the weekends albeit with a criminal element.  If you don't get involved, you'll be just fine.  You should speak some Spanish though for sure.  I go frequently and I even took my parents there when they visited me a few weeks ago.  I did tell them it was time to go when my dad didn't listen to me and started taking pics with his iPhone X.\n\nAlso, you should definitely put Doctores on the avoid list.  There are some very nice parts that are across the street from la Roma but in general it's pretty bad.  Also, I noticed you had certain neighborhoods listed in Neza and Ecatepunk.  Those cities are pretty much no-go zones for tourists entirely.  There's really no reason to go to either anyway.  If you want to see Ecatepunk, take the sky tram thingy and view it from above.",

Here are my thoughts, as a Mexican who really makes something out of every meal and i would called myself a \"seasoned eater\" haha.   \nContramar: It's really good, one of the best seafood restaurantes in Mexico City. Is it worth the hype? IMO no. This applies to both Contramar and Mi Compa Chava. They are worth trying but i would never do the 1+ hour lines. Try to go there off hours like super early lunch or late dinner.  \nMasala y Maiz: I've been there twice, i think they are good but not as good as reviews. I had to go back because i thought first time i had bad luck, same experience 2nd time.  \nRosetta: Bakery/Pastry game in Mexico City is INSANE these days, Rosetta is a would example of this. their Guava Roll it's outstanding, but these thays you get same qualty/flavor ratio in 10 more places. I would throw in there Maque or Matisse for their Conchas, Ficelle for pastries, Macorina for scones, etc.  \nAzul Historico: Good, not excellent. If you're going for the place (beautiful) go for it. There are lots of good \"new mexican food\" restaurants. Try Testal.\n\nOrinoco: Good tacos. Their chicharron one is outstanding. Again i would go off hours, i don't think it's worth the long lines.\n\nEl Cardenal: Very good. Very traditional, IMO their breakfast game is stronger than their lunch/dinner. Try to go the the downtown branch (original one), it's clearly better than the rest.\n\nEl gran abanico: Famous for Carnitas (deep fried pork) and tacos. Very good but kind off away from everything else. It may be worth the trip.\n\nCoox Hanal: The reason i wanted to answer this post. This place is a gem. I don't think it's that tourist friendly, hard to find, gotta go up a flight of stairs in the middle of nothing. But man is worth it. Best \"cochinita\" (pork with adobo from the southeast peninsula) and great food.\n\nI'm more than willing to hit you with some other places. If you want DM me.\n\nHave fun, eat as much as you can and be safe.",

It has a nice vibe and many restaurants/galleries, you can combine UNAM and San Angel in one day. \n\nIn downtown, I would add to your list the \"Monumento a la Revolución\", Chinatown (it's pretty small but still interesting to see), \"Palacio Postal\" (lovely building), \"Museo Nacional de Arte\" (lovely building + some art exhibits), \"Museo Memoria y Tolerancia\" (new-ish museum built by the Jewish community in Mexico City, very interesting), the \"Alameda Central\" (a park next to Bellas Artes) and the lookout at Torre Latinoamericana (particularly during sunset). They are all next to each other. \n\nPolanco is another popular neighborhood with a couple of museums (particularly Soumaya and Jumex) and upper-scale restaurants/shops (particularly around Masaryk avenue and Parque Lincoln). It's next to Museo de Antropología so you can combine those in one day. \n\nSanta Maria La Ribera is another nice neighborhood next to Biblioteca Vasconcelos, the main square (Kiosco Morisco) is a nice spot for walking around and having lunch. \n\nCondesa-Roma are extremely popular among foreigners. In those two, I would recommend walking around Parque México, Parque España, Plaza Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam and Alvaro Obregon streets, and Glorieta Cibeles.\n\nWalking around Reforma Avenue, from Chapultepec Park to Reforma 222 is also quite interesting. You will see some nice skyscrapers (particularly Torre Reforma, quite an interesting building), the Korean town, the LGBT area (known as Zona Rosa) and the Angel de la Independencia (one of Mexico City landmarks). Here, I recommend having a drink at the City Zen bar in the Sofitel hotel. It has a very nice view of the city. \n\nI would also add biking in Reforma-Condesa during Sunday. From 8am-2pm on Sundays, the city closes Paseo de la Reforma and many other streets to motorized vehicles (making them bike and pedestrian-only) and it is a lovely way to explore the area. You can rent a public bike through the \"Ecobici\" app or borrow one from many kiosks around the route (you will need your passport to do so). Highly recommended.\n\nEnjoy Mexico City!",

Ubers are plentiful, and the area is relatively chill. Lots of cool places within walking distance. The pricing isn’t really all that bad either, and it’s a really nice spot.\n\nRealistically, if you carry yourself with any semblance of confidence, people don’t really mess with you in any part of town that I went to. (There are the couple spots that they say to shy away from, which we *mostly* did.) some people told us to avoid that area, but I walked around for a day trying to find a covid test for my wife the first time we were there, and everyone was so friendly and helpful when this lost gringo was clumsily trying to ask for info with only a basic understanding of the language. \n\nThat being said, most places, unless super touristy, are not heavy on speaking English. It’s a commerce city more than a tourist destination, so there are a bunch of locals just trying to do their jobs and don’t need to use English on a day-to-day basis.

It's not downtown, but it's worth the trip! \nAnd have a nice stroll from the Alameda central to the Zócalo.

Some little catrinas, maybe a lead soldier, some traditional mexican toy...\n\n4.- Find the places where you can see from higher viewpoints.\nLike this [Cafe finca don Porfirio] (https://maps.app.goo.gl/9ZkwWJLSeKtC3qSi8)\n\n5.- Can't help you here. One of the reasons to visit Mexico is to have tacos and amazing food. I'm sure there's no vegetarian substitute for any of those. It's just a different cuisine. \n\n\n\nAnything else: \nLearn basic Spanish phrases\nUnderstand the subway map and how to navigate it. It's the cheapest/ most reliable transportation method. Just be careful for pick pocketers.\n\nNever take a cab from the street,  and I mean NEVER EVER. If you're lost, walk,  it's safer. Use Uber instead, it's very reliable. \n\nPlan your visit! At least have an idea of the places you'd like to visit. It's a huge huge city and you might feel overwhelmed easily. Sometimes, you'll only have time to do one thing a day.\n\nIf you can, visit Coyoacán in the south. It's a different experience than downtown and also very beautiful. \n\nThat said, be smart, nice, and open.

Honestly there is just so much to do, i think others have mentioned Chapultepec Castle, the zoo is next to it and free (though not the nicest zoo).

Mexican food is very regional so make sure you look for restaurants from Oaxaca, Yucatan, etc., but for me, after a while, I was aching for \"Italian\" food and really liked Macelleria Roma in Roma Norte, and Pizza del Perro Negro for a very unique but delicious take on pizza.

I really wanted to see authentic Mexico over the Americanized parts, but a trip is a trip so I’ll take whatever I guess. Staying in Cancun would also mean I don’t have to take another flight to Oaxaca, which will probably ease minds as well. Is Cancún safer for solo travellers? Is it worth it and are there other touristy areas that are considered safe? And how’s the safety in Puerto Escondido?? Thanks!!",

I would also suggest going to the Tenayuca Pyramid and the Santa Cecilia Acatitlan Pyramid, which are less known.  \n\r  \nThe Anthropology Museum is a world class museum, which you should put aside 4-5 hours to see everything.  \n\r  \nChapultepec Park is beautiful to explore and the Castillo de Chapultepec is worth the cost fo entry for the views alone.  \n\r  \nTemplo Mayor is fascinating.    \n\r  \nIf you can get tickets to Lucha Libre on a Friday or Saturday night, you won’t be disappointed.  Buy the best tickets you can on Ticketmaster.  \n\r  \nFonda Margarita for breakfast (the beans will change how you view beans) – try and be there about 8am at the latest.  Tacos Al Pastor at the original Tacos El Huequito and gorditas at Las Gorditas de Sevilla.  Churros at El Moro.  \n\r  \nSouvenirs at the Mercado de Artesanías La Ciudadela.",

We visited the castle in the park and it was amazing. It's very nice how affordable the museums and attractions are. There's lots of parks in the city and I suggest trying to find a hotel near any park because the parks have lots of street food and food places to walk or read in your spare time. I'm in La Condesa and I love the park here. \n\nMight I suggest taking a fight to Oaxaca? I think after spending a week in Mexico City you'll want a change of pace. Oaxaca City is an hour flight away (my flight cost about $100 on Viva). There's amazing mountains and some of the best hiking I've ever done. I also found that hotels were more affordable. It's very fun to explore new neighborhoods and cities. Even if you stay in Mexico City, I would recommend changing hotels part way through so you have access to new food and sights. For instance, the historic center is very different from Zona Rosa which is very different from La Condesa.",

Shorts and t-shirts/tank tops will help locals easily spot you as a tourist. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you view it. My most valuable tip, if you visit museums, always ask if there's a student discount (if you are a student or have a student ID), because they usually give you a 50% discount or a free entry. Also, no need to exchange currency in the airport. I brought $0 in cash and went to a Banamex (which had the cheapest fee) when I arrived and withdrew with my debit card. The ATM charges ~$30-$40 MX to withdraw which is about a $1.75 USD.\n\nI'd say Castle Chalputepec and the Pyramids are a must see!",

I'd say just avoid asking questions to people walking on Paseo de la Reforma as they all seem to be in a rush to go somewhere. Also, avoid answering questions while walking there too. There's people who waste your time by asking you to do surveys and shoe shiners who'll ask to shine your shoe for free then try and charge you. Wear sneakers to avoid that last one.\n\nI can't imagine you and your girlfriend are planning to visit Tepito, which was the worst area I visited. I visited it because I take a different appreciation for thing, but even locals told me to not go there. If you do, just avoid going near the evening. \n\nI walked the city and used the metro at all times of the day from 6am to 12am and never had a problem. If you don't want to commute on foot or metro, Uber is always available and is really cheap! For added peace of mind with pick-pocketing wear pants/shorts with buttons for the back pockets, if you have any, and always just double check backpack zippers when you're in a crowd. \n\nI wouldn't worry at all about kidnapping.

Any and all recommendations, including day trips and hotel stays, are welcome!:)",

        "body": "This is cut and pasted from what I recommend to friends who are going:\n\nTake a taxi from the airport (Uber can only drop off there). look for a taxi booth once you’ve cleared customs. They charge a flat rate. After that use Uber to get around. It’s safe and inexpensive. Taxis often don’t have seatbelts and can try pulling the usual taxi scams. They’re fine in a pinch though. \n\nDay 1.  Historic Center walking day\n\nPalacio Bellas Artes. See the murals inside \n\nCasa de los azulejos. At least view the restaurant inside\n\nVisit the crooked cathedral across the street from the Azulejos restaurant entrance after\n\nPeek into the old post office\n\nView the meteor displayed off the street across from the art gallery \n\nPeek into the national museum of art.  Visit if you have time if not save for another day. The architecture inside is amazing and the art is great\n\nContinue to the Zocalo\nMetropolitan Cathedral \nTemplo mayor and museum (lets you explore the pyramid ruins)\nLunch or snack at El Mayor, or the place beside it. Both look down on the ruins of the temple. Accessible via the first floor bookstore. Quesadillas are good there\nPalacio nacional. Seat of the president. Tours are free with photo id. Diego Rivera murals inside. \nGrand hotel Ciudad de Mexico. Ask bellboys if you can zip inside to view the amazing stained glass ceiling \nWalk around the nearby streets. Some glass viewing windows into the ruins below the city\n\nTorre latino América. Pay to go up to the top for a cool city view. (If you have time)\n\nPlaza de la fundación. Supposed spot where the aztecs spotted the eagle devouring a snake, their divine sign to settle the area\n\nPalacio de Iturbide. One of the oldsters buildings in the city\n\n\nDay 2. Art market and museums\n\nMercado de la Cuidadela.  Fantastic art market. Bit of a maze inside a walled in center. Glass, ceramics,  metals, clothes,  artwork and souvenirs.  Have lunch at the restaurant in the center.   Good margaritas. Turn left from the main entrance and there’s also the Mercado de San Juan nearby, a decent food market. (If you have time only)\n\nMuseo de arte popular.  A fantastic relatively small museum featuring colourful examples of Mexican art, traditional and modern. Featuring many works by some of Mexico’s “maestros del arte”, some of mexicos best recent folk artists. (We have some of their pieces at home). One of my favourites.\n\nIf still have time, head to the Museo Nacional de Arte. The neoclassical building is beautiful on its own, and the collection of  art from various periods of Mexican history is excellent.\n\n(Museums in Mexico City are usually closed on Monday)\n\nDay 3. Coyoacán \n\nStart at the Zocalo. Explore a bit. The streets surrounding it are nice. \n\nMercado de artesanías near the square is cool. Art and knickknacks.\n\nMercado de Coyoacán is a great market as well. Authentic. Food, art, souvenirs.\n\nCasa Azul. Frida’s house. Cool, but don’t expect much of her art there.  Stroll around after. The whole area is nice.\n\nNo strong food recommendations, but Taqueria los Parados and Cabo Coyote were good. Maratea ristorante has a beautiful courtyard and typical Mexican breakfasts, though is Italian after. Recommended taquerias: Khalifa, Taquearte, el tizón, el fogoncito.\n\nDay 4. Chapultepec park\n\nAnthropology museum. It’s big, but the Aztec stuff is at the far end of you want to prioritize your time.\n\nChapultepec castle.\n\nCarcano de Dolores, Tlaloc fountain. Cool formally submerged Diego Rivera mural at the old water station.\n\nMuseo de Arte moderno. Very good smallish museum in a cool building. Couple of famous Fridas, Rivera, carrington, and other Mexican greats\n\nRufino Tamayo museum. Picassos, Dali, etc\n\nWalking around the lake and park is nice.\n\nLunch at Del Bosque. Restaurant on the water\n\n\nDay 5. Bazaar del Sábado, San Anjel \n\nUber out there on a Saturday when the street market and art markets are out. It’s a must on a Saturday, (I’m sure it’s great other days though). Take the uber to Saks, and have breakfast there. It’s beautiful restaurant and the food is great.  \n\nThe baazar del sábado is just up the street. Higher end art and wares.\n\nA little further up is a small ‘tianguis’ Saturday market covered in tarps. At one corner of it there is a small quesadilla stand. It looks dodgy but it’s legit and you won’t get sick. They put their kids through Med school apparently cooking on that little hot plate. It’s delicious and popular. \n\nOn Saturdays there’s lots of artists displaying their stuff in all the parks\n\nCasa del obispo. Very cool little art shop with a nice courtyard \n\nParroquia San Jacinto. Cool little church\n\nThe shops by mercado del Carmen are cool to poke around in.\n\nMuseo Del Carmen.  Frescoes and mummies in an old monastery \n\nMercado de las Flores, flower market \n\nIt’s basically just a nice area to explore. It’s a must if you’re there on a Saturday but probably awesome other days too\n\nDay 6. Teotihuacan pyramids\n\nVery cool. Do on your own or with a tour. A guide is worth it. Early morning ballon rides are the way to go.\n\nLa gruta Teotihuacán  is restaurant in big cave behind the pyramid of the Sun. Super cool. Only uses prehispanic ingredients. It’s quite an experience.\nLa caverna. \nReservations required for both\n\nPeople sometimes visit the Basilica de Guadalupe on the way back\n\nDay 7. Roma \n\nI don’t know it well actually but hear it’s very nice. Maybe fit in some museums or stuff you didn’t get to on other days.\n\nLucha Libre\n\nIt’s a must. It’s just crazy and fun. Fit it in on a Tuesday or Friday night. Tuesday is a smaller show. Only go to the ones at Arena Mexico, (the other nights are in a rough neighborhood). Buy the tickets and check the schedule through ticketmaster Mexico. Lots of masks and souvenirs for sale out front",

        "body": "I would suggest you do the Turibus tour on your first couple of days.  It is a jump on, jump off bus that has stops all over Mexico City.  You can just do the entire ride and get a big overview of Mexico City, or, get off an explore anything that grabs your attention, and jump back on later.  There are three different routes and the cross over at different places.  You can get a one day or two day wristband.  Two things that are not to be missed are the Anthropology Museum and the pyramids outside of Mexico City.  You can combine the trip to the museum with a walk around Chapultepec park, which is right across the street, but I would leave a whole day for the Pyramids.  Bear in mind, that Mexico City is somewhat high altitude, so take it easy your first day.  Personally, I would stay in an AirBnb as opposed to a hotel.  First, they are cleaner and safer, and two, you can get a glimpse into what life is like day to day for a typical Mexican, if that interests you.  There are great coffee shops all over, but I would skip Starbucks, haha, it´s just like the US, but more expensive and the baked goods are mass produced and mediocre at best.  I would suggest looking for a Panaderia, El Globo and La Esperanza are two good ones, just go in, grab a tray and tongs and go wild.  I lived in Mexico City for many years (I live in Zacatecas now) so feel free to ask any specific questions you might have.",

But Roma and Condessa are super touristy areas, and filled with demanding Americans who live there who insist that everyone speak English.  Most of the restaurants are overpriced and food is meh at best.  Mexican looking Mexicans have been treated shabbily at many of those places.  Polanco, for the most part, is filled with rich, snobby Mexicans who will be thrilled to have you there.  Again, overpriced.  Reforma is a mixed bag though, you will see a little of everything.  As a middle class Mexican, I haven´t stayed in hotels for many, many years, preferring to stay in AirBnb´s in normal, middle class areas.

Tichuchi in Polanco was one of our favorite meals we had there. So good. (We went to Pujol and had their tasting menu and tbh it was really meh.) Panaderia Rosetta was yummy, though there are certainly cheaper panaderias around with great pastries.\n\nWe did the hot air balloons over Teotihuacan and that's a very cool experience but if you're short on time, I'd stick to the city itself. \n\nThis was a dope food tour we did, especially since people have an idea of Xochimilco as a party boat tour that I think super cheapens how cool it really is there. It also was a neat walk through one of the oldest mercados in the area: [https://culinarybackstreets.com/tours-food-tours/tours-mexico-city/2017/city-green-exploring-urban-eco-reserve-xochimilco/](https://culinarybackstreets.com/tours-food-tours/tours-mexico-city/2017/city-green-exploring-urban-eco-reserve-xochimilco/) The guide Victor is an absolute gem.\n\nCondesa/Roma are going to keep you in good food and drinks no matter what, Polanco is ritzier and a bit sleepier for nightlife but is pretty to stroll through (especially to stop for cocktails at Limantour!) We didn't make it to a few of the places we wanted to this time but Hanky Panky, Handshake are some places that seemed cool. Contramar is always sold out but its sister restaurant Entremar in Polanco has the same menu and usually has a bit more availability. \n\nWe were just there a few weeks ago and I already miss it.

I guess my point is that—especially if you don’t speak Spanish—it’s entirely possible that you genuinely owed some money for some reason and they were having trouble explaining the situation to you.\n\nBut regardless, here’s the good news: Cancún in general is world-renowned for scams, full of gullible tourists and people trying to take advantage of them. Mexico City is one of the biggest travel hubs in the hemisphere, full of literally all kinds of people imaginable.

One thing I do is to sort reviews by New.  This lets me see if a place has gone downhill recently, is in the middle of some sort of remodel or closure of some facility, etc.  I also sometimes double check reviews on a second review site, since some places will game reviews on one site, but rarely on multiple.  \n\nFor remote tours, I start by reading the reviews carefully - I will almost never invest either a lot of time or money unless I can check reviews.  I'll pay a bit extra to go with the place with the good reviews. My brother recently tried to get me to use a tour guide who was a friend's cousin - checked the reviews, and they were terrible.  This is the biggest place I think I disagree with you - there's a lot of great stuff far from city centers; be smart about how you choose.\n\nI think I work harder than you to get away from touristy stuff.  Generally, it's the very touristy places that scam tourists - once you're away from more touristy areas, you can take more risks with places that seem a little sketchier in some way, e.g. cash only.  A lot of times, I do things that are a bit risky, and then trust my intuitions - I think I've traveled enough now that I can usually spot danger or scammers.  If I'm in a place where the dollar is strong and costs are low, I don't worry as much about being scammed - if I pay $20 when I should have paid $10 and I have a good time, I'm cool with that.",

Walking is my favorite way to discover a destination and I can easily rack upwards of 20 km a day visiting a new place. However, as I get older, I find that I can't go on 4-5 day streaks of walking so much anymore, at the risk of completely burning my body out, which then requires a good 2 days of rest to get back to normal. That said, it's a flexible rule and if I feel like going out exploring on a day with no plans, I can still do it, just... more chill lol. \n\nSo the past few years, I've embraced easy days and haven't chastised myself for spending the better part of a day in bed or just loafing around when I feel like it. It's made the rest of my travels much more enjoyable, and has actually allowed me to better appreciate the cities I visit, since those days feel like \"normal\" days and you experience your surroundings differently if you just step out to get food, run an errand, just take a quick walk, etc.",

I usually do not have a lot of trouble with taxis.\n\n>**3. Booking Hotels and Airbnbs**\n\nNever got into Airbnb. I usually go with prebook first night and last night.

Those I book as soon as possible, I usually go with Close to sights and next to public transport if possible.\n\n>**4. Dinner, restaurants, drinks, partying**\n\nMy rule of thumb is => avoid if the menu is in more then 2 languages or if the menu is not in the local language. Restaurants that cater to locals should have the Menu in the local Language, maybe a second English menu somewhere if they expect tourists from time to time. If the first Language on a Menue is English in a Country that does not have English as its native Language then the Restaurant caters mainly to tourists.\n\n>**5. Tours, boat rides, museums**\n\nMy nr 5 would be check google Maps for everything that is marked a sight, read the reviews, check out how to get there if it sounds interesting. That gets one way more places then \"Top 10 must see in ....\" and helps avoid the \"nothing much to see here\" places. Also helps to plan a DIY Tour if you are already on google maps.",

In particular, Mexicans place a high premium on politeness. Entering a restaurant, start with \"Hola, buenos días (or tardes or noches), followed by \"como estás?\" (or como está?), and more.

To be fair, the food is something really big and intense and will probably fuck up your stomach for a day or two so that’s something to take into account. It is delicious tho so it would be convenient to plan ahead and be ready for a rematch when you feel fine again; happens to all tourist I’ve known except if they’re already from a country that makes spicy food like India or Korea. To each his own but having travelled to Europe for example, 7 days are nothing to get to know a country and those are smaller cities.

Those overly fancy taquerias in places like Roma or Insurgentes just sell overpriced stuff that is mediocre at best.

If the place is a \"taquería\" or \"mexican restaurant\" and it's full of white people and foreign tourists, get out. The good stuff is where the locals eat, specially if the place is crowded.

I'd rather go to Tizoncito, Huequito, Fogoncito, or even Califa, which most purists sneer at, but I love. Avoid Orinoco, unless you want to live the full expat experience.\n\nEthan: In terms of Mexican food in CDMX, you have the ultra-high-end places, like Pujol and Quintonil, and the taco stands with plastic plates wrapped in plastic bags, with a queue of 25 people, from all walks of life, and all levels in between. You can have amazing food everywhere, but it helps to set expectations that fit the place.\n\nNico's is one of the best restaurants in the city. I'd certainly go there. Merotoro is also delicious. Fonda Fina, Comedor Jacinta, Ribera del Sur, Fonda del Recuerdo, Dante Brasa y Fuego, Azul Histórico, Campobaja, Rosetta (but it's Italian-inspired), Lardo, Eno, bar Limantour for a great bar with great pub food, Pollos Poncho. \n\nIt's ok to go to Condesa, Roma, Polanco, but the adjacent neighborhoods have great stuff. Don't neglect Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, Santa María La Ribera, and San Rafael.\n\nAnother amazing thing you could do is to take a walking foodie tour with [Eat Like a Local](https://eatlikealocal.com.mx/).\n\nFeel free to DM me for ultra-biased opinions, hahaha.

Azul y oro in the university. It is a restaurant based around the research on traditional food from all around the country. Here you can have a sample of almost everything.\n2. Fonda del viajero close to metro normal. It is mostly Puebla style food. It was really popular with people of the government around the 80s. They have a promo where if the food is not good, you don't have to pay.\n3. For Oaxacan food you can try the El mayordomo spots, it is mostly focused on Oaxacan chocolate, mole and such. \n4. A block from bellas artes there is a place called Fonda santa rita, the best for quesadillas and corn based stuff.\n5. For a classic dessert spot, go to el moro, aldo close to Bellas artes.\n6. Go to lagunilla on sunday, they have a lot of gourmet food in the street and an antique market. Just be careful because it can be a bit sketchy. Also, I don't drink, but micheladas and gomichelas are really popular there.\n7. To try some sea food Sinaloa style (my family is from there) try los arcos or mi gusto es. Los arcos is a classic from Culiacán but is a bit expensive.\nI don't recommend taco places because all of them are great. But remember there are different tacos for different times of day. My favorite breakfast is barbacoa and tacos like pastor and sudadero (a classic from the city) are always had at night.\n\nGood luck on your trip and don't doubt to write if i can help",

I still want to go, I completely understand their situations however I have the money and everything planned to a T. My other family members really don’t want me to go alone, this would be my first trip abroad (I’ve never even been on a plane before) and I’m definitely nervous but still determined to go.

Ill just say again walk past everyone in the airport except for the person holding the sign with your name (or resort's name)\n2. Make sure you keep the immigration from you get from the plane with you, you'll have to give it back when you fly out of the airport. It's a pain in the ass if you lose it (like I did my first solo trip to MX)\n3. Don't be afraid to book a group tour out of the resort if you want to see another part of the region, go to Chichen Itza, go to one of the theme parks, etc. All of the X theme parks there are pretty fun if you want to switch it up, and I can't stress enough how safe they are (really, no difference going to a zoo or park in the U.S.)\n4. Once you're in the inclusive just relax and enjoy being in another country. No need to worry at all",

Taking a taxi will be double, if not more. The busses are self-explanatory, but the subway can get tricky. Keep valuables in your front pocket. If you're a guy, the front of the bus is for women, and there are subway cars specific for women cause there are some hombres who can't keep their hands to themselves.

I’ll give a short answer and then a longer one. \n\nTL; DR: if you have 5 days, do CDMX. If you want to spend more than a month, do GDL. Living, GDL by a country mile. \n\nMexico City is a world class city. Has everything you could want. At a price tag that matches. The good areas are close together as well. Like you never need to go south of Condesa, north of Reforma, east of Roma, and west of Polanco. With the exception of seeing specific things. There are boat loads of cafes, parks, restaurants and things to keep you busy. As well as a lot of foreigners and expats to mingle with and you don’t need to learn Spanish. The women are pretty enough (assuming that’s your thing) and all speak English. At least the ones you’re going to want to date. The city is big for cocktail lounges and rooftop bars. The restaurants are very good and world class too. \n\nNow if you’re looking to embrace yourself in the culture more and actually have a different experience, Guadalajara is the better play. GDL doesn’t get many foreigners. So the people are happy to chat and find out where you’re from. Don’t be surprised if you get invited to a random carne asada. They aren’t going to kidnap you. Just get you drunk and listen to them sing amazing songs very badly haha. Granted, English isn’t as widely spoken. So you’ll need to try to learn Spanish. Which is very rewarding and a beautiful language. The food is pretty good. Not as diverse as CDMX but have amazing quality all the same. In terms of dating; the women here are famous for being beautiful and down to earth. CDMX girls (chilangas) can be stuck up. Definitely if she’s a “fresa”. As for women from GDL (tapatias), they are great. The city nightlife is a bit more laid back too. However things aren’t as walkable here. Ubers are cheap though. \n\nSorry if I went on a tangent. Just ask more questions or DM if you have any specifics",

Apparently la ciudad is very territorial when it comes to license plates. Paid parking is everywhere and very normal in Mexico. Look for a blue E, which stands for estacionamiento. \n\nFurthermore, you will have to temporarily import your vehicle at the border, and there is almost 100% certainty you will be stopped by the police to ensure you have correct papers for it, by police who do not speak English. And if you don't have those papers, be prepared for a very...**very**...hefty \"fine\" (bribe). Legally temporarily importing your vehicle involves leaving a deposit with the Mexican government that is like 20% the value of your vehicle or something? Also I am 90% sure the vehicle must be made in America and a certain number of years old, but that might only be for permanent imports. \n\nAll of that is to say, it is possible but I wouldn't necessarily say realistic, and I certainly would not recommend driving a US-plated car in Mexico City.",

It's roughly a 1-hour ride to Teotihuacan, which is the last stop.\n\nAlternatively, if that sounds like too much work, you can take an Uber there, which will be significantly more expensive but probably slightly faster and more comfortable. While I was there, I noticed that the tours only started arriving at 11-12, which coincides with peak hours (rather annoyingly large crowds). I would not recommend, but I also did not go in a tour group so don't take my word for it. Tours get there in their own buses.",

I tell people to budget 5 hours personally.  I have been multiple times and you want to take your time.\n\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is nowhere near the rest of the items you have for that day, so I would suggest adding it to a different day.\n\n>I am looking for very good street tacos or any area that has a lot of street food and exciting markets\n\nEl Huequito on Ayuntamiento (though recently they haven't been serving while you stand on the street like they always have in the past).  They're famous and regarded as the best Tacos Al Pastor in CDMX.  Otherwise, there are going to be places literally everywhere and you just look for the long queues.\n\nThe main market in CDMX, Mercado La Merced, is a wild experience.  It's huge, with everything from vegetables and meat, mole and chilies, to underwear and piñatas.  \n\nMercado De Artesanias La Ciudadela is a artisan market which is arguably the best place for souvenirs, but also worth walking around for a few hours.\n\n>Day 3\r  \n\r  \n\\- Teotihuacan ( how did you guys get here? should I book a tour when I get there? )\n\nAs with other comments, take the public bus.  It's not as hard as you might think.  Depending on what part of time you are staying in, you just take the metro to the bus station and buy a return ticket.  I advise people to go as early as they can to avoid the tour buses.  It's an hour and a half on the bus in traffic, and you want to be there for hours.  \n\nWhen you return, if you have any energy left, you'll be in the North part of CDMX at the bus station and will be close to the Tenayuca Pyramid and Santa Cecilia Acatitlan Pyramid.\n\nThe tours are often way more expensive than the bus, and usually include Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and a souvenir shop.  I personally wouldn't bother with a tour.\n\nDinner recommendations depend on where you are staying, but CDMX is your oyster.\n\n>Day 4:\r  \n\r  \nI have a bit of time before getting to the airport so I am looking for some good breakfast places?\n\nFonda Margarita.  Without a doubt.  It is open early (so long as it is open that day).  You HAVE to eat the refried beans and egg, it will change your thoughts on beans for life (weird statement, but everyone I know who has been there agrees).  I like the steak in pasilla as well, but the menu also has different offerings each day (I love chicharrons, but found it to be too rich there).\n\n>Coyoacan area\n\nI have only been through there on the way to Xolchimilcho.  You might want to leave it for the next time, as there is already so much on your schedule.  CDMX is huge and full of amazing places to explore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo Lucha Libre?",

Amazing food and nightlife, just like Condesa, and amazing museums.\nThe con, however, is that it's really chaotic and noisy, as well as where most popular demonstrations end. The president lives there, so the streets can also get closed and open daily whenever a big shot goes through. But if you're into history, you could spend a week there and still have buildings to visit!\n\nHope this helps",

We'll also go to a lucha libre show.\n\nWe're definitely goign to visit Kidzania because it looks so unique and I think my kids will love it. My kids enjoy museums so I'm hoping to narrow down the rest of the amazing looking museums into a smaller list of must sees.

Both museums are the very best for kids, especially those ages. Unfortunately, both of them are whole-day experience, and adults might get bored. Although, it's great to see your kids have fun by themselves. \n\nLucha libre should be fun for everybody. You need to explain them what lucha is all about if not they might get scared.\n\nFrida Kahlo is mostly for adults. As well Museo de Antropología; however, just outside of it there is a great show of \"voladores de Papantla\". Very interesting for all ages. Also, you can buy \"real\" vanilla from them. Papantla is the place vanilla is from. \n\nCastillo de Chapultepec could be interesting because there are many things to see. They need to walk uphill, though.  \n\nInbursa aquarium is fun. That zone is nice and great to walk around. \n\nDepending on the day, there are always fun activities for families all over the city. I recommend checking it out some sites (like dondeir.com). For example, MAP (Museo de Artes Populares) has an kite exhibit right now. That museum has the best craftsmanship Mexicans can offer. It's a museum they are not for sale, but it's really impressive. I don't know if kids that age would be as impressed, though, besides the kites.\n\nCentro histórico is a must if you don't mind being around thousands of people. It's really interesting: architecture, stores, museums, churches, but mostly people. You'll see. \n\nOne more thing: there are more things to do that you can actually can do. Kids get tired. Do not overextend and try to do too much. Traffic is toug, time consuming and people get tired being in it. Plan around traffic.",

        "body": "It's cool that you invest such a long time in Mexico City! Being from Puebla, I find it a cool city to live close enough to (although I would find it a nightmare to actually live there, lol). There's always a lot of cool cultural stuff that you can look into. Check these links for events in the next few days: [Cartelera CDMX](https://cartelera.cdmx.gob.mx/), [Time Out México](https://www.timeoutmexico.mx/ciudad-de-mexico/que-hacer/que-hacer-hoy-en-el-df).\n\nA few comments on your itinerary:\n\n* The Anthropology Museum is massive. You should really plan *a whole day* for it, and even then you'd need to pick exhibition rooms as it's impossible to cover in its entirety.\n\n* There isn't really a lot of sightseeing in Roma/Condesa, but that's a nice part of the city to hang around in because of the cafés, restaurants, and parks. I wouldn't necessarily invest a full day for it, but visit it at least once to see if it's your deal, and if so, return a few times for breakfast or for a lazy afternoon.\n\n* You should really look into the natural places in or around Mexico City. The easiest to access (after Chapultepec III sección) is the Pedregal de San Ángel, which was formed after a volcanic eruption that shaped the geology of the southern portion of the valley about 1000 years ago, creating what is a rare subhumid *malpaís* (volcanic wasteland). You can visit either Espacio Escultórico at UNAM (and combine it with MUAC, Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporáneo) or Bosque de Tlalpan, which is an urban park in its front part and a deep oak forest/*palo loco* shrubland the further you get in (and combine it with Cuicuilco archeological site). The montane regions like Ajusco, Los Dinamos, Río Frío etc. are worth a visit, too, if you like intermediate hikes or light mountaineering.\n\n* Day trip to Puebla? Yes, absolutely! Puebla is easy to access from TAPO bus terminal (metro San Lázaro, pink line). Get a bus to CAPU, not Paseo Destino as that terminal is poorly connected to the Puebla city center. Although I'd say that one day is a bit short for Puebla, you can visit the city center and also the Cholula pyramid if you arrive early. Urban buses to Cholula are fast and cheap ($10), departing from close to Mercado de Sabores. Cholula is also full of pretty awesome restaurants and bars in case you want to spend the night.\n\n* Other day trip? Look up Tepoztlán, that's also a cool place not so far from the city. Try to leave that for a weekday, though, as it gets packed during the weekend.",

[See this page for other examples in Spanish](https://mexicanspanish.com/articles/verme-la-cara). Guatemalans generally don't like Mexicans, the prevailing opinion is that they're crass and foolish and we're still pissed that they got Chiapas after the Capitancy of Guatemala was broken up and that they then furthermore tried to annex more land and that ended up in some compromise. Sure that was in the 19th century but it'll be a while longer before that bad blood dies off and I'm half convinced we're still upset with them over what their Aztec ancestors did to our Mayan ancestors. If we weren't such a subservient people we'd be pissed at the United States for the shit pulled from the early 20th century into the 80s and then CAFTA in the 2000s, but hey we have this gringo worship fetish so that won't ever happen, but I digress.\n\nAnyway so what probably happened was that the guy did understand the Mexican but was annoyed by them. And when you said you didn't understand the Mexican rather than let you lose face or deal with the awkwardness of that situation he cracked a joke at the Mexican's expense.\n\nRegarding the travel advice, many Mexicans are aware of what words are purely Mexican and what words are Castilian or used instead of the Mexican form in other Latin American countries so they can usually adapt and try to meet you in the middle. There's also the matter of the Chilango accent but you'll probably only encounter that among the lower classes and it's just very sing-song at best with elongated vowels at the end of words.",

They're easily recognizable by the large McDonald's logo on their stall sign.  They have a number of meats, but the highlight is that all their tacos are massive and come topped with nopales, charred green onions/cebollas de cambray, and fresh cut crispy French fries (think McDonald's fries at their best).  One taco is filling, two is a whole meal.  Plus there are a number of surrounding stalls that specialize in pozole and other soups if you want to make a crawl out of it.\n\nContramar is delicious, but gets packed every day, so hit it early.  The tuna tostadas and pescado a la talla Contramar (the fish with half green and half red sauce, if you look at their Instagram check-in's) are the signature dishes, but I also recommend the cobia/esmedregal al pastor tacos.\n\nLa Casa de Tono is very good, though part of its charm was in being a 24/7 place you could hit after a late night at the bars.  I believe it's no longer 24/7.  Had a friend from CDMX recommend El Pozole de Moctezuma, but didn't make it myself.\n\nEl Tizoncito is another famous pastor place, often considered a rival to El Huequito as to which is the leading pastor chain in the city. Orinoco, which was mentioned, does a Monterrey version of pastor/trompo, and is very good too.\n\nLismoneros does great upscale takes on classic Mexican dishes, and always has some fun twists on tacos, with a little less hype than your Pujols and Quintonils.\n\nMariscos Playa D'Sinaloa and La Embajada Jarocha are two places to try if you want to compare and contrast West Coat Pacific (Sinaloa) and Gulf Coast (Veracruz) takes on seafood.\n\nLa Pitahaya Vegana does tasty vegan variations on tacos, and is very Instagram famous because they use pink tortillas.\n\nGet a pambazo and a blue corn quesadilla (make sure to ask for cheese if you want it) or tlacoyo from a random street vendor.  Recommend huitlacoche or flor de calabaza for fillings.\n\nBottom line is there's a ton of excellent food in the city, so narrow down what kind of specific food you're most looking for ahead of time so you don't drive yourself crazy with FOMO.",

Definitely welcome to all suggestions! \n\nAny good food recs near the places I'll be are highly appreciated",

There are plenty of bars and clubs in the surroundings.\n\nCafe paraiso is fun, mostly mexicans go but some foreigners go as well. The avenue Alvaro Obregón is full of fun stuff to do. Rooftops are also quite nice like Toledo or Supra.\n\nMost nice places might need a reservation so just call a day before to reserve a table they usually have a minimum consumptions of about 300 usd or something like that.\n\nPulquería insurgentes is fun, really local, and you can try our pulque which is pretty much how aztecs used to get drunk. A type of fermented cactus beverage, but they add natural fruit flavor to it and is veeeery cheap.\n\nThere are some high end clubs like Republica, Or Sens where you will mostly see rich white mexicans, but girls are very good looking although might be harder to talk to. Music is usually very fun. Make sure to check what is the recommended age in different clubs, some clubs are for people 17-20, others are for 20-27 year old people. And there are some clubs mostly for older folks. There is something for everyone.\n\nMake sure to check salón tenampa, a really old saloon with mariachis everywhere, tequila an traditional food.\n\nOf you have a big bunch of people it is usually very fun, try not to walk around the area late at night because it could be dangerous just make sure to order and uber and walk from and to the restaurant without getting too distracted. But its alright not be afraid of it. 99% of people there will be mexicans\n\nPeople in mexico are in general friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes girls do most of the flirting work. So just go out there have fun. Dont lose track of your friends if you all go out and just be smart about it. If possible avoid paying with cards at clubs.\n\nI would recommend going to the Lucha Libre at arena Mexico as well.\n\nIf you see street food with long queues of locals, its probably worth to check it out too.",

You must check the \"semaforo epidemiologico\" (no fking idea how to say the first word on english) and check what stores, parks, restaurants, etc. are open.\n\n\\-I've seen some decent apartments where you looking for but I haven't got any references or info about, and about the cost, might bee higher than 500 dlls.\n\n\\-Check on Youtube or any social media whick bank is beeter for people like you, contact them by phone or mail or anything...

My \"folio\" (a paper they give you when you present your document exchange VISA) was marked as \"Express\", so I don't know if they are doing that for everybody or just for residencies with working permits (I guess maybe they are a bit more high priority since people need their card to get paid), but in the worst case scenario, I think by law they can't take more than 15 working days to give you your residency card.\n\n**What area do you live in?** \n\nI live in Polanco, which is a bit more expensive when comparing to Condesa, Roma, and Coyoacán. It's also a very different vibe. It's nowhere as trendy or hip as those neighborhoods. It's more commercial or \"executive\" looking, but it also has really nice parks and a lot of very popular bars and restaurants (although right now it's not really relevant since it's still not safe to go out... but well... eventually).\n\n**Any tips on how to find those groups to meet new people? Are there clubs or FB groups?**\n\nFB is used a lot in Mexico so that's a good place to start. There are also a lot of expat groups with people in similar situations. But in the end, it really depends on what you are looking for.",

Guanajuato is the only city where I've felt like a 3-D street map was necessary.  The views and houses are stunning, though the streets were not very clean.  Puebla is trying really hard to be tourist friendly.  Some of their attractions were nice (Teleferico, forts, gastromony), I enjoyed the great pyramid of Cholula (probably the shiniest shrine I've ever seen up on top... Spaniards trying to one up), and the attractions up on the hill with the forts were pleasant too.  That said, their minibus system was important for getting around and not the easiest to understand.  Like Guanajuato, it has a nice rich historical feel with colorful buildings all over.  Querétaro... felt more like a business oriented city?  It seemed to be thriving and well off, but I couldn't \"get into\" the city or the culture the same way I could in Puebla or Oaxaca.\n\nAnother one to add: Dolores Hidalgo has a nice central plaza and a few interesting revolution related historic sights, but I was done there after a couple of hours.  The drive over the mountains from Guanajuato was pleasantly scenic.",

It’s a lot but you get some great perks. That card includes a credit for Global Entry or pre-check. It also includes travel insurance on every trip. On thing I do is I have 2 of everything. I never unpack my bag. I take out the dirty cloths and put in the clean. That way I never forget anything because it doesn’t ever come out of my bag. Traveling well is a skill. I’ve spent over 7 years in hotel rooms. I’m lifetime Diamond with Hilton and with 4,000,000 miles flown I’m lifetime platinum with American. As you carryon you want the TravelPro Platinum Elite. Lifetime warranty so you will never buy another bag. I’m on my 3rd one. Paid for the first, next 2 were free. Tami is also good but twice the price. Just assume anything under $300 is not going to work. Traveling every week puts a hell of a lot more stress on a bag. On American you seldom get lounge access through flying. Occasionally they will have a promotion but I haven’t seen one in awhile. Pay the money for the credit card and use the perks. I’ve been Executive Platinum for around 15 years. Also, consider a high end backpack. I use an EverKi. Going to cost around $200 but it’s well worth it. Bose Quiet Comfort noise cancelling ear buds are a must. I also carry a Bose portable speaker for my hotel room. There’s an app called calm that’s great for travel, I use it as a sound generator to help me sleep in strange beds.

If you apply with a passport instead of a drivers license as your personal identification you’ll get approved within a few hours.\n\nOne thing to consider when buying luggage is that on European airlines carry on size is smaller. 55 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm (21.6 inches x 15.7 inches x 7.8 inches) vs 22 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches.

It’s what all cabin crew buy.\n\nGetting a passport is fairly straightforward and the recent backlog of processing is gone. Just make sure that your photo meets the rules and has good contrast.

Unfortunately, I do not believe that I qualify for the Citi Executive card, and am certain that I cannot meet the minimum spend required to receive the sign-on bonus. Even if I do, I do not book my own travel, accommodations, or rentals and would not be able to take advantage of the 4x rewards on bookings. I'm not sure that the Global Entry credit and lounge access outweigh the AA status level perks (and miles that I can redeem for lounge access) that I would be able to achieve with the Citi Platinum card which rewards purchases more in-line with my usual spending, but that's what I'm trying to figure out.\n\nBoth fortunately and unfortunately, my travel schedule is sporadic. There are week-long trips with weeks of no travel in the interim, but then also short 48-72hr turn-and-burns with only a few days of recovery between. I have two of some things (chargers, contact lens case, etc.), but my needs are often determined on a trip-by-trip basis and I have to pack accordingly (eg, a week-long trip to the high desert Southwest in Winter versus a 3-day trip to the Southeast US in Summer). In any case, a sturdy dependable carry-on will be necessary, and you've only confirmed my suspicions that the TravelPro is the way to go. \n\nThank you for the backpack recommendation!

You should probably also assume at least one part of the trip will have bad weather, and plan a little flexibility into your trip.

        "body": "HIDDEN GEMS:\n\n- Drag brunch in SF - SO MUCH FUN!\n\n- Mount Vernon in DC - Estate of George Washington, very very modest by global standards for a head of state - puts into context why it was so shocking America won it’s independence, and how little wealth there was here at the time. (Also a good program on the lives of enslaved estate workers.)\n\n- Washington National Cathedral - DC. This modern gothic cathedral completed in the 1970’s has a beautiful garden and Is pretty in its own right, but it’s famous for several things including it has a chunk of moon rock embedded in one window, and a Darth Vader gargoyle! \n\n- Food in DC: more than any other American city, you have every imaginable cuisine packed into a 10 mile radius. If you wanted to try Ethiopian, Korean, Ghanian, Kenyan, Vietnamese, Peruvian, Bolivian, Russian, Serbian, Lebanese, Indian, Thai, Canadian, Laotian, German, Polish, Japanese, Swiss, French, Italian, Spanish, Basque, Moroccan, Egyptian, or pretty anything else you can think of, it’s here, all in one place. I recommend DC Eater website for local info, and Washingtonian Magazine’s Bargain Restaurants list and 100 Very Best Restaurants list.\n\nITINERARY:\n\nTo put into context, it takes 60 hours to drive coast to coast through the center of the US, without stopping. \n\nIt takes 5 hours to fly coast to coast, and you’re crossing 3 time zones - which means flying West to East, 5 hours plus 3 hour time change = 8 hours. You will lose a full day just flying back to catch your flight home. That’s the shortest time, with no connecting flights.\n\nThree cities in 2 weeks max. DC you will need 2 nights minimum - that’s 1 full day and a half day. You will only scratch the surface. You’ll get a bus tour, 3 Smithsonian museums, and 2 dinners. That’s it.\n\nPhilly is a 2 hour drive from DC without traffic. With traffic it can be 3, depending on where you are going. By train it’s 2 hours, but you’ll need to take an under into the city center which will take 30-45 more minutes.\n\nNY to DC is 4 hours by bus/car, minimum, and can be 5-6 depending on when you arrive. It’s 4 hours by train.\n\nSF to LA is going to take 6-8 hours to drive depending on traffic, or 90 minutes to fly. Las Vegas is a 8 hours driving from SF, or 90 minutes flight.  It’s 4 hours from LA, or 45 minutes flight.\n\nAmerican cities have moderate to poor public transit so everything takes longer than you think to get to. You’ll be mostly dependent on cars/taxi/uber. \n\nNew York’s subway is labyrinthine, and has many Z MANY closures and detours, and we have nearly missed Broadway shows too many times so now we just take Uber or walk. \n\nLA has the worst traffic in the nation, and gridlock is infamous. If you get stuck in the Sunset Strip at rush hour, you can easily spend an hour going 1 mile/1.6km just trying to get to a hotel or restaurant.\n\nSan Francisco is sprawling and 90% of the city is on steep hills, so you’re not getting anywhere quickly. The airport is south of the city and it will take you 45 minutes to get to the waterfront or hotels on Nob Hill or North Beach. The Golden Gate Bridge backs up with traffic so prepare 2 hours to cross the bridge and take photos and return.\n\nAND you’re coming in April - that’s cherry blossom festival time in DC and one of the tourism peak times, so be prepared to pay more for centrally located hotels.",

Honestly, you could spend a week there if you like that kind of thing. There are endless things to do there. Unpopular opinion, but Philly is actually great if you like museums and history. DC can be done in two days, tops. Boston is good, depending on what you’re interested in, but as a tourist I’d hit Philly over Boston. There is also plenty of scenic countryside in the northeast if you’re seeking that. Of course, it’s not too terribly far to Niagara Falls or even Toronto, too. \n\nIf you wanted a short side trip, consider Chicago. Absolutely fantastic city, and vastly underrated!",

        "body": "I strongly disagree with everyone saying to pick a coast. It’s absolutely doable.  It’ll take up a couple hours, but I’d go to a Yankees baseball game while in NYC. If you like that, hit up another baseball game in another city.  Even if you’re not into the sport aspect, you’ll get a great bit of America at the game. People in the US are more open to talking to strangers, so I highly encourage striking up conversations with people you find yourself near.  I’d limit museums unless there’s something specific you want to see. Yes, there are some amazing museums, but do you really want to spend your time here, inside like that? NYC can be exhausting with all of the walking- keep that in mind.  Also, people are more fast paced there. The biggest tip anyone will tell you for NYC, is if you’re going to stop while walking,  especially in a busy area, move to the side.  People may also tell you that Times square is awful, and to avoid it.  It is awful, but you still have to experience it- ideally at night.  Look into Brooklyn as well as Manhattan. See if that’s an area you’d like to spend time in. It’s cool and Brooklyn alone is larger populationwise than most US cities. \n\nIf you’re going to San Francisco, definitely make a side trip to Muir Woods.  It’s not far and it’s cool.  \n\nThere are so many different and cool areas of the US. Europeans I’ve known seem to love Las Vegas. Im not personally a fan, but I get it. Even if you’re not into gambling, it’s just a lot to take in, and can also offer a little relaxation.  You may want to think about adding it. 1 day even.  Maybe make the 6 hour drive from Vegas to San Diego.  For a couple days, get a taste of the desert and the west before heading north to San Francisco.  If you’re set on LA, don’t stay downtown.  There’s nothing of note there.  Venice beach area maybe? LA  to me is best in he coastal parts.  Keep in mind many US cities are huge sprawling areas made up of what could be considered smaller cities.  The traffic in and around LA and NYC is really bad. It’s easy to avoid in New York by not driving, but LA doesn’t have good public transportation.  Don’t get caught up with LA because of the name and notoriety.  It’s simply not the easiest or best place to travel to in the US and on a short trip, it may not be worth the time and effort.   Just south of San Francisco is the big surf spot, Mavericks and a really cool town called Half Moon Bay.  \n\nAlso consider weather.  East Coast that time of year can vary a ton.  It may be chilly and rainy in New York or it may be warm and sunny.  You can even get both on the same day.   San Francisco can be chilly.  DC should be warm and nice. Just be prepared for a little weather variety.  \nI’m excited for this trip for you and your parents.",

Late breakfast is also a good option.\n\nFor old school fine-dining in Juarez/Zona Rosa, I’d go to Bellinghausen. Grilled artichoke appetizer, mushroom soup, beef filets…all really good.\n\nFor a casual lunch of Cochinita Pibil, I’d go to Cochinita Power in San Rafael. Tacos, tortas, panuchos. As good as El Turix (that is in all the guide books)\n\nFor duck tacos, tortas, and some Asian/Mex fusion, try El Auténtico Pato Manila (a few locations…the Roma location is the original)\n\nThere are some unique foods here like a torta de tamal (a tamale on a roll) sold by many street vendors in the am until like noon and sometimes in the evening. Pollo con salsa verde or Rajas are usually good bets.\n\nMachetes (2’ long grilled quesadillas with various fillings. For a local stall, I’d go to Los Machetes de La Guerrero.

Greasy…yes, but delicious.\n\nBarbacoa (barbecued goat or lamb in maguey leaf) Try La Oveja Negra in Santa Maria La Ribera (my neighborhood) open F-SU. Really great and unique experience. Visit the Alameda de Santa Maria with the gorgeous kiosk when you’re there.\n\nFor an old school cocktail in a unique bar or gorgeous lobby, pop in to Hotel Geneve on Londres in Zona Rosa.  \n\nDon’t miss some of the more well know places like Bar Opera for a drink at the bar. Azul Histórico in Centro for a gorgeous breakfast. El Cardenal in Centro for an old school lunch. El Havre 77 in Juárez for a $$$ French dinner or lunch. Panadería Rosetta in Juárez for coffee and a pastry or jelly donut. Chilakillers in Escandon for giant chilaquiles. Meroma for a glass of wine and some foie gras in Roma.

One of the larger places, they have a fantastic Japanese garden and it is a very relaxing place to go for a meal, the fish is also fantastic and if you're into it they have Teppanyaki (Hibachi for Americans).\n\nThe three above are in my opinion some of the best. Some other ones I can recommend with a bit more reservation are:\n\n* Moog in Roma Norte is fantastic but very expensive and it can get very crowded due to it being in the most touristy area.\n* Suntory (Both the one in Las Lomas and the one in Narvarte) is fantastic, but also incredibly expensive.\n* Daikoku is good but can be a bit hit or miss depending on which location you visit (they expanded massively before the pandemic).\n* Morimoto and Nobu are great but massively expensive and not off the beaten path in the slightest, so not what you're looking for.\n\nFinally and sadly I recommend you **don't** go to Deigo in Del Valle. Before it would have been at the top of my list, however, recently they reduced the menu and portions, and added new stuff that made the place much less authentic than before (I believe a change of ownership has taken place). This one specifically makes me sad as it was one of my favorite places to go on special occasions.",

This maybe my personal bias but imo food in Taipei are slightly has better taste than HK lol. Taipei's night market is awesome! If you decide to go Taipei i suggest to go night markets like shilin or ximending (do expect sea of people and long queie if you come in weekend tho). Recommended food to try : chicken strips (Ji pai), mango shaved ice (man guo bing). For Hongkong, ofc their dumpling is must try! (Could be pricey tho)\n\n\nnature and landscape wise I think both are beautiful,  HK ngong ping and victoria peak are beautiful, TW had Jiufen, Elephant mountain, shifen waterfall, and ofc Taroko (do mind that Taroko is in Hualien city which is pretty far from Taipei city, if you really want to go there, consider it as 1-2 day trip from taipei and  book a local driver from taipei/hualien city). \n\n\nIf you want to go to theme park, ofc HK win big ways with their disneyland, ocean park. But TW had plenty cool rollercoaster like this (lihbao land gravity max)[https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaA4_BjmHzAM]\n\n\nregarding language, I think you dont need to worry, HK is very english friendly, most of Taipei public bus and inside city also has english instruction, but if you go outside of taipei (e.g. Hualien) it would be a pretty challenge tho without a local guide \n\n\nmy suggestion is why not both? :) if you use HK cathay airline (CX), they usually had a flight with 1 day layover in HK, you can go to Taipei and then spend layover day in HK during your departure/arrival from Taiwan",

Getting around by train everywhere was an absolute breeze, all signs are in multiple languages and google maps makes it very easy to get around with public transit directions. Similarly very easy to travel across the country to visit different cities like you wanted to using the Shinkansen (bullet trains) or domestic flights. Once you are in the country it is incredibly inexpensive for hotels/food/entertainment and there is lots to do across the spectrum of big city amenities, museums/historical monuments, Michelin restaurants, sporting events, and amusement parks (highly recommend universal studios in Osaka). We did 2 weeks in June for our honeymoon and it’s by far our favorite trip we’ve taken. Most importantly it is so vastly different than anywhere in north/south America that it really felt like big exciting and exotic vacation but still very comfortable with how clean and safe the country is.",

I'm quite a social and active traveller, I like cities with lots of things to do and see and eat but also looking forward to some beach activities and trying to surf etc. and I do enjoy taking part in the nightlife.\n\nPuebla looked like a good option to break up the journey to Oaxaca, however if its better to use that day elsewhere I wouldn't be averse to flying to Oaxaca either (or doing an overnight bus although I've heard this might not be the safest option) so would be keen",

There are so many museums, you’ll have ample time to check out as many as possible with that timeframe, plus branch out into the ruins outside the city if that interests you as well. If you like mezcal, I recommend you check out Ahuehuete collection room. I’m obsessed with Templo Mayor and the Zocalo (best meal I think I ever ate was at Balcon del Zocalo). And the park…we stayed in Polanco and La Condesa just to be within walking distance of Bosque de Chapultepec. Agh, I’m wistful just thinking of it. Have a vegan milkshake from Goy’s for me! \n\nAs far as the rest, the only surfing/beach experience I have in Mexico would be Los Cabos area.",

Right now I’m staying in a boutique hotel that reminds me of my grandmother’s Spanish colonial-style house with adobe bricks, brightly colored walls, a courtyard and garden, and exposed wooden beams. Guadalajara is my favorite foodie city. Since it’s such an international city, you can find great options of all types of cuisines at all price ranges. I cringe whenever I see posts on here about safety in Mexico when there’s from some extremely dangerous cities in the US. I’ve felt more unsafe walking through Oakland and downtown LA during the day than I have walking through Guadalajara or Mexico City at night.
