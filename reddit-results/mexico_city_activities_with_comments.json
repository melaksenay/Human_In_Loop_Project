I live a 1 miles ahead Roma and know the area pretty well.\n\nYes, you can find the pricy restaurants and fancy cofee shops but yet you can also get a bunch of street taquerias, fondas (cheap restaurantes with daily based menus from 4 to 8 usd) to quesadillas stands. The main reason is because Roma is SO BIG that no everybody are hipsters or fancy people. Actually there are less of the named last that the others.\n\nOf course, you can choose Narvarte, Centro Historico or Coyoacan (as some people suggest) but eventhough all of those have their own things. Maybe I would suggest Narvarte or maybe -and remark this- Doctores, depends on the spot. Avoid Centro Historico IMO, very crowded and needs to be a fancy well secured building. Such a sketchy area.\n\nThe pros with Roma (and this is very clear) is some many places you can do walk distance. Zona Rosa? Walk distance or 2 Metrobus stops. Reforma? Walking distance or 3 Metrobus stops. Condesa? Ridiculously walking distance. Metrobus (one of the biggest routes) is just in the middle between Roma & Condesa called Insurgentes.\n\nI am a (Mexican) city person and also a traveler and of course when go to places I‚Äôd like to visit the less ‚Äútourist‚Äù spots and places. But maybe this one (Roma) is good ‚Äòcause is pretty well located and you do not need to use so much Ubers or stuff.\n\nHope this info works. Welcome to M√®xico.\n\n\nPS.\nSorry my broken english.",

Roma is pretty big, and it's got walkable areas and non-walkable ones.\n\nYou'd need to be familiar with the area to know for sure, but a rule of thumb is that large parks and streets with landscaped medians on the map usually mean good walking environments for several blocks around.\n\nRecommendation #2: hire a driver for a week or so. You can usually convince an Uber, Lyft, or DiDi driver to be available independently on your schedule. This can be invaluable for you to get the most out of your time in the notorious Mexico City traffic.\n\nThen invite them to lunch and dinner on the days you hire them, on the condition that it be to their favorite places to eat in whatever part of the city you're in at the time. That will guarantee a good, authentic, local experience. This works not only on CDMX, but almost anywhere in the world.",

CDMX is an international city and will be diverse \n\n5.) CDMX is one of the biggest cities on earth and is extremely complicated. There will obviously be some neighborhoods for rich people as there are for poor people, as well as middle class families, young people, business districts etc., this is just what cities are like. \n\n6.) The wires are normal. NYC looked like that until they buried them all in the same move as building the subway. Berlin probably did the same thing.\n\n7.) the prices are expensive everywhere, but I do not find the grocery prices to be different from where I expected them. I‚Äôm curious where you shopped to find prices higher than Germany. Also, the Balkans are extremely cheap - cheaper than CDMX, so that really shouldn‚Äôt be surprising. All through Albania, Bosnia, N. Macedonia, you can find beers for ‚Ç¨1 and coffee for ‚Ç¨0.75 cents. And Serbia, Croatia (outside of Dubrovnik and Split, but still moreso), Bulgaria, northern Greece really isn‚Äôt much more. \n\n8.) I have not experienced that creepy vibe you describe, but I am a larger man so maybe that‚Äôs why. The only places I‚Äôve felt that was like Tepito and Doctores, which are pretty common to avoid. I do think the armed guys on the back of the trucks are kind of whack but I‚Äôve literally never seen them do anything. I prefer the Istanbul/Taksim method of just having tons of undercovers or the NYC way of just having a uniformed cop on every street corner throughout midtown, giving directions. But, again, Mexico City is it‚Äôs own entire place that is rightfully different from other places. \n\nIdk, it sounds like CDMX is just it‚Äôs own place that‚Äôs different from other places. \n\nIt‚Äôs also funny that you try to commiserate as if you yourself are not an immigrant. It also should have been pretty quick for you to learn that ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù do not automatically equal ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù, and even clothes/fashion is not often a good indicator. If you talked to them you might have been surprised to find out they were Mexican nationals. \n\nSome neighborhoods are gentrified, obviously, but acting as if one of the most important and complicated and biggest cities on earth is somehow going to be ‚Äúruined‚Äù by a couple thousand Americans with laptops is crazy. It‚Äôs insulting. \n\nDo you also dislike that there are Turks in Berlin? Or Mexicans in Madrid? Or Pakistanis in London? Do you dislike the Chinatowns of every major city on earth? CDMX is way closer to Berlin than it is to places that actually have been ruined by overtourism, like Tulum or Puerto Escondido. CDMX is a massive international city‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt complain when demographics or development happens.\n\nSorry for the essay but seriously these sentiments from tourists are so tired. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt consider Mexico City to be a real global international city and so they think they can get cool-guy points for bitching about gringos.\n\nP.S. - Little fun fact: CDMX is the 47th highest production urban area in the world by GDP. And Berlin is 6 places behind it, at 53rd. You weren‚Äôt visiting a cute little Mexican beach town, you were visiting a global economic center on par with Istanbul, Madrid, Riyadh, Wuhan, Melbourne, etc. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP",

If you go to e.g. Bodega Aurrera prices are lower for sure than at your typical Rewe/ Edeka.\nSame applies to food stalls/ restaurants. A place in Colonia Doctores will offer a full lunch menu for 100pesos/ 5 Euros. Again in the more gentrified areas you will pay same or more than in Berlin.\n\nWith regards to the language, my Spanish is level A1/A2 so not sufficient to have long talks about life but sufficient to get around. I found it charming to not be answered to in English despite my Spanish not being that good.\n\n10/10 will recommend the city overall, especially the culture with its rich history is something worth experiencing.\n\nEdit: Changed Walgreens to Walmart.",

        "body": "Terrible takes from OP, aside from the air quality and gastronomy. I think OP had strong stereotypes in his head about what Mexico would be, and it was a weird combination, he wanted the bad Mexico to be awful as in drug dealers everywhere, but at the same time the Americanized Mexico they show in Netflix where everyone speaks English.\n\nI don't know where OP bought groceries, but I've been to Walmart, Soriana, and another chain supermarket in Mexico City and the prices were, at worst, just the same as any other place in the US. OP seems to be based in Eastern Europe, in which case I can see some things being more expensive, but compared to Western Europe and the rest of North America prices prices were in most cases cheaper, at least for fruits and vegetables, meat way cheaper, chicken prices had some fluctuation but for the most part also cheaper. I have no idea where OP went shopping for groceries. There's some high end supermarkets, and they are more expensive but not twice more expensive.\n\nGoing out at night? Unless OP was in the really rough neighborhoods, I also have no idea what he means. Maybe OP is a tall person and everybody stared for a bit? I know a 6'4\" guy walking around makes the locals turn but 0.5 seconds later they go back to what they were doing. But that happens everywhere. I went out several times and never felt anything I don't feel when I go out at home. If anything maybe more people letting loose? Also I did not see the military, I saw armed police in some shopping malls but on the streets I saw regular police, and just as police here carry shutguns while riding around, same over there. Seems to me OP doesn't go out much, and this creepy aura is just the general vibe of any popular zone where people are drinking and partying.\n\nWires? Yeah OP is almost correct here, except I never saw wires at head height. Being an old city and also extremely populated, only in newer parts are the power lines buried, other than that there are thousands of power lines and telephone lines going along every block.\n\nEnglish spoken here? Not for the regular person. They know a few words sure, but why would they speak English when they live in a Spanish-speaking country where the absolute vast majority of their customers also speak spanish? Go to office buildings or the ITEMS school and English is all you hear I kid you not. I spent a couple of days there and all the students spoke perfect English.\n\nPolanco is just a really high-income area and not an area invaded by the wealthy of other countries, also Mexico is not just poor people and people with darker skin, there are white Mexicans, rich, poor, short, tall, even blonde ones, with dogs, and people out jogging at 9-10 am, I've seen this in every city I've visited from Mexico City to London, there are people out doing regular things in the middle of the morning even if the rest of the public is at work. Go to the north of the country to see broke ass white people, again, it's a huge massive country with something like 100+ million people, there's all different colors and shapes and sizes.\n\n> I read a lot in this subreddit about locals hating rich remote workers etc coming in and changing the place and I guess it's evident there. Everyone there just looked American wealthy, carefree, stay-at-home mom type unaware of the surroundings etc.\n\nThis is what OP wanted, hatred of foreigners. Those people you saw were yeah rich and yeah probably remote workers, but chances are most of them were Mexican.\n\n> even though nobody knew where Croatia was or what it was about \n\nNo offense but I don't expect the common Croatian to know much about Mexico either, probably only what they see in the media (the bad stuff) which is probably what OP thought Mexico was about.\n\n> For my Mexico city locals: I feel for you and your pain for remote workers changing your landscape. Prices are high and I don't imagine salaries match them. Going out to nice places and seeing a bunch of Americans and not a lot of locals is also shitty. \n\nOP is assuming Mexicans hate foreigners. I'm sure some prices are higher than they used to be in some very specific areas of the city, but a pound of chicken at Soriana is affordable or as  affordable as it can be regardless of how many migrants of light-skin are walking the streets in the Roma Norte beighborhood. I don't think those remote workers are changing the landscape, the plastic fake feel OP felt in Condesa is mexican, as fake as Rodeo drive is in Beverly Hills. The different feel is because some of those niches inside the city seem european, others feel colonial, others feel very popular, some are very population dense and other not so much.\n\nMexico City is super old and a huge city, just like London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and any other economic capital of a region. I'm sure OP will be shocked to know there's a huge Jewish population in Mexico City, also a ton of people from India, China, the Lebanse apparenly have great numbers in Mexico City for some reason, not to mention the massive number of people from Cuba and Argentina that I met while being there, it seemed like one out of every 5 was from another country. And also a large number of Americans, not tourists, but people living there, probably more than in the UK.",

In Denver I've enjoyed Forest Room 5, Williams and Graham, Green Russel, etc. We've lived here 5 years and here are my recommendations for CDMX (some of them have been mentioned already):\n\nZona Rosa (Juarez basically):\n\n* Xaman (part of the fun is finding it, down and alley and down some stairs)\n* Handshake Bar (DM on instagram for reservation. they used to have a daily code to get in, not sure about now, but DM them for sure)\n\nJuarez:\n\n* Hanky Panky (same as above. hint: looks like a place that sells tacos). Reservations on OpenTable.\n\nRoma:\n\n* Casa Franca (downstairs is an Italian restaurant, upstairs is a secret Jazz Club and cocktail bar. They also serve food. Check out their Facebook page for nights they will have live music and to make a reservation)\n* Limantour. This is simply one of the most famous bars in the city. Nothing particulally interesting about the location itself, but the cocktails are good. If you want to stroll Alvaro Obregon (same street for this and Casa Francas above) then this would be a nice stop.\n* Casa Prunes. This place is new and specialize in fermentations and making their own wine. Upstairs and in the back they have a speakeasy called El Laboratorio that specializes in clasic cocktails. They can also serve food here. Show up around 5 wed or thurs and you'll get in. Little expensive but worth it.\n\nCentro (make sure you visit centro! it is beautiful and like nothing else in the city):\n\n* B√≥sforo. Hole in the wall, but famous mezal bar. They have like 300 mezcals and you can order a variety to try out. Some of them are smooth as water.\n\nPolonco:\n\n* Nothing worth seeing in Polonco right now, imo. It is a \"nice\" area, but boring.   \n\n\nAlso, someone recommended Caf√© de Nadie, but it is over-rated. Nothing special and service is slow given how many people show up.",

Off the top of my head, some of the most memorable places we went to were:\n\nDrinks: Xaman, Handshake bar, Helena. Limantour was frankly kind of disappointing. Not a complete disaster or anything, but the hype just didn't match the drink quality in my opinion. We found a few other random places but I have no idea where I was on the map and can't remember the names. Too many good options.\n\nDinner Food: Helena again, Rosetta, Nudo Negro, La Pitihaya (Vegan)\n\nBreakfast: Boicot cafe, Cicatriz cafe. The second one was good but maybe not great - I think if I lived there though I could be there all of the time because it's so low key. We walked by Cafe de Nadie and it was slammed so we didn't even try.\n\nWe also asked various bartenders about their own favorite places, and one wrote the following list on our last night (interpreting some handwriting here, so spelling may not be exact):\n\n*Teclan\n*Bosforo (really wished we could have hit this)\n*Clandestina\n*Lavanderia\n*Cafe Ocampo\n*MUX (also restaurant)\n\n\nI've been all over the place (NYC, LA, Rome, Delhi and Mumbai, Budabest, Madrid, Lagos, etc etc) and I feel comfortable saying that CDMX may be the best food city in the world. I never had a bad meal and the many other times that we just stumbled upon a place and had a drink or food were all great.\n\n\nFinally, the anthro museum was cool but just so big that at some point your eyes glaze over. Couldn't get in to the Frida Kahlo house, so if you're planning on that look at tickets now. Did a day trip for Teotihuacan, which I think was great for the wife who had not seen pyramids before but I'm glad that's the only full day trip out of CDMX we took. We really enjoyed leaving Roma on foot a little bit and walking through Parque Mexico in Condesa and parts of the Centro. Also hit a club (tons of fun) and a lucha libre event at Arena Mexico.

        "body": "This post caught more attention than I would have imagined. Here are my thoughts, as a Mexican who really makes something out of every meal and i would called myself a \"seasoned eater\" haha.   \nContramar: It's really good, one of the best seafood restaurantes in Mexico City. Is it worth the hype? IMO no. This applies to both Contramar and Mi Compa Chava. They are worth trying but i would never do the 1+ hour lines. Try to go there off hours like super early lunch or late dinner.  \nMasala y Maiz: I've been there twice, i think they are good but not as good as reviews. I had to go back because i thought first time i had bad luck, same experience 2nd time.  \nRosetta: Bakery/Pastry game in Mexico City is INSANE these days, Rosetta is a would example of this. their Guava Roll it's outstanding, but these thays you get same qualty/flavor ratio in 10 more places. I would throw in there Maque or Matisse for their Conchas, Ficelle for pastries, Macorina for scones, etc.  \nAzul Historico: Good, not excellent. If you're going for the place (beautiful) go for it. There are lots of good \"new mexican food\" restaurants. Try Testal.\n\nOrinoco: Good tacos. Their chicharron one is outstanding. Again i would go off hours, i don't think it's worth the long lines.\n\nEl Cardenal: Very good. Very traditional, IMO their breakfast game is stronger than their lunch/dinner. Try to go the the downtown branch (original one), it's clearly better than the rest.\n\nEl gran abanico: Famous for Carnitas (deep fried pork) and tacos. Very good but kind off away from everything else. It may be worth the trip.\n\nCoox Hanal: The reason i wanted to answer this post. This place is a gem. I don't think it's that tourist friendly, hard to find, gotta go up a flight of stairs in the middle of nothing. But man is worth it. Best \"cochinita\" (pork with adobo from the southeast peninsula) and great food.\n\nI'm more than willing to hit you with some other places. If you want DM me.\n\nHave fun, eat as much as you can and be safe.",

Family ambience. \n\n- El Cardenal (for breakfast). Very beautiful, good prices and traditional.",

You can go to Bosque de Tlalpan (South M√©xico City), Desierto de los Leones or Ocotal Park (though I don‚Äôt recommend you going alone, for it can be dangerous due to general security issues). Good Street food you will find plenty in Polanco, Condesa, Roma, Del Valle or Narvarte. I recommend you take time to walk around Downtown (Centro Hist√≥rico) visit Mercado de San Juan, and enjoy the various bars with panoramic terraces. You must visit Bosque de Chapultepec, Reforma there you will find amazing museums (Antropolog√≠a e Historia, Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo, Castillo de Chapultepec) and maybe walk to Polanco area to visit Museo Jumex and Soumaya. You will also find MUNAL and San Ildefonso museums pretty epic (those are in Downtown). If you walk around San Rafael neighborhood or Santa Mar√≠a la Rivera you‚Äôll see a lot of street art, maybe go to Ciudad Universitaria. Obviously you must go to the Torre Latinoamericana for amazing panoramic views.",

It's all more than a little ironic considering that Frida was a reclusive, non-conformist, anti-capitalist.   Anyway... the blue house is now a bit of a circus -- long lines, crowds, vendors, etc.  Many people trying to visit a small house.  It's a cool little museum, especially if you like Frida, but it's debatable whether it's worth all the hassle and hype.

        "body": "I'm a home cook and also love eating out, honestly I believe CDMX has the best price/quality/variety food available in the whole world. Maximo Bistrot, Rosetta, **Meroma** and **Pasillo de Humo** (mole almendrado with chicken ftw) are amazing, I'd rather dine at Quintonil than Pujol but for less $$$ I'd rather have the tasting menu from **EM by Lucho Martinez**, love the food Lucho makes. Lucho and Rodney from Meroma are some of the most passionate chefs currently in the city.\n\nFor tacos yeah, forget Califa, **Vilisto** is a good option for pastor, personally I like **Tacos Manolo** but that's just me. Don't get me wrong Casa de To√±o, el huequito, los tolucos can be good but nothing special. I¬¥m also very fond of \"**El Villamelon**\".\n\nI'd seriously add to your list the following restaurants:\n\n**Sartor√≠a** from Marco Carboni. Italian chef that has worked with Massimo Bottura and Gordon Ramsey, marco and Jorge Vallejo (from Quintonil) became firiends because Jorge's wife loves eating at Sartor√≠a. They change their menu constantly but their lasagnas never disappoint and if they still have Tortellini en Nieve you have to try that dish. The chef, in an Italian fashion, uses the best local ingredients he can find to create some incredible dishes. IMHO the food served here is on par with the best food I've had in Rome and Florence.\n\n**Rokai Ramen Ya**. If you like ramen you have to try their \"Tan Tan Queso\", on par with the best ramens I¬¥ve has the opportunity to try in Japan. I'd also argue that thier yakimeshi is amazing, although that can sometimes be under salted (I always ask for some salt if that's the case). As a dessert their Lyche Icecream is delicious. You can share both the ramen and the yakimeshi if you go with someone else. If you don¬¥t have someone else hit me up lol. They¬¥re also pretty well known for sushi but I don't think their sushi game is on par with Japan's.\n\nFrom the same group that owns Rokai I'd also recommend the omakase at **Hiyoko,** a yakitori place that then again is on par with some amazing Yakotori places I¬¥ve been in Japan, some even with a Michelin star.\n\nFrom the same Chef's from Rokai there's **TRES** a sando joint in la roma, pretty fucking good. If you go there you have to try their kimchi fries with aioli. They just have one small table though so I usually take my food to the nearest park and eat it there.\n\n**Niddo** has been growing on a constant basis and their success is well deserved imho. Run by mother and son is an amazing place to have breakfast or brunch. For breakfast I love their Shakshuka, on weekends it always gets pretty crowded.\n\n**Joe Gelato** he worked at Pujol and then went to study at the Gelato University in Bologna, and boy did he study hard. Best Gelato in Mexico City, no question. Pistachio and peanuts are my favorite flavors.\n\n**Forte Bread and Cofee**, the chef Rafa is a master baker, great spot for breakfast, they also have some amazing pizzas. \n\n**TIZNE** just tried this one yesterday, cool taco joint in la Roma. Maybe check them out.\n\nA couple of places I haven't tried yet but are on my list **Galanga Thai House** and **Kiin Thai-Viet Eatery** from chef **Somsri Raksamran** (Thai and Vietnamese food) and **Makan** (singapur).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a great trip",

For example, you can type ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù in the search bar and then filter by cuisine type, price, ‚Äúopen now,‚Äù and most importantly, rating. Check the newest ratings for the most accurate results.
